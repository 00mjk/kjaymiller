## Active Projects

### [Render Engine]
[Render Engine] is a static-site generator with Flask/Django like flavor to it.
With Render Engine, you work with classes that build from one another to create
web-sites quickly that you can use for prototypes for full time use!

### [Diversity Orgs.tech]
[Diversity Orgs.tech] was originally created as a demo to show the ease of building a search platform with [Elastic App Search](https://www.elastic.co/app-search/).

It quickly became a resource that I was using to find diversity organizations to collaborate with. 

Now it is a FREE directory for people to search for diversity focused organizations in their area.
