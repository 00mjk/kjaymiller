[When It Comes to Focus, Use It or Lose It](https://lifehacker.com/when-it-comes-to-focus-use-it-or-lose-it-1826427712)

This reminds me of Elizabeth Gilbert's idea of "Inspiration" in [*Big Magic*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594634726/?tag=kjaymiller-20) where it comes and leaves when it *feels like it*.

> "Ideas of every kind are constantly galloping toward us, constantly passing through us, constantly trying to get our attention."
