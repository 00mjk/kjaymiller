Link_title: Friction less authentication based on how you type

I think it's great, but I have a bunch of thoughts concerning this. 

What about children still learning to type?

What about people with multiple devices/keyboards? My typing changes drastically depending on the input source (like my phone vs my iPad vs my Laptop/iMac)

Good starting point but I hope they've taken these things into account.
