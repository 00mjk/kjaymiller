I've used Anker products before (like this [Anker 5-Port USB Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-Multi-Port-Samsung/dp/B00VH8ZW02/ref=sr_1_4?sr=1-4&qid=1527799299&keywords=anker%2Bmulti%2Busb%2Bcharger&dpSrc=srch&dpID=41MsFvYtt8L&ie=UTF8&preST=_SY300_QL70_&s=wireless)) and I trust them enough to buy two (One for my wife)!
