I have two thoughts on the upcoming WWDC. 

**PODCAST APPS PLEASE ADD FILTERS TO PLAYLISTS TO FILTER OUT PHRASE WORDS... I'M TIRED OF ALL THE TECH SHOWS SAYING THE SAME THINGS ON THEIR _WWDC_ PREDICTION SHOWS**

This also goes for Hardware release events and current events that everyone wants to talk about. 

I know this is a personal issue and I normally do not have this problem. I just wish that I could temporarily (or permanently) filter out episodes. Maybe the team at [Castro](http://supertop.co/castro/) will be able to implement this. ðŸ™„

Now for my WWDC Thought: (LOL I know right!?!?!)

Let me be able to write code on the iPad (and test it). I just want python 3.6 (or higher). 

While I doubt this is will happen (not at first), at least allow me to write swift code on the iPad. iOS seems to be the only platform that you can't write code for. 

If you can't do this, at least expand Workflow to make it more usable. You bought the company Apple, you can extend its usability.
