link_title: Microsoft confirms itâ€™s acquiring GitHub for $7.5 billion

I woke up looking forward to WWDC news and started by finding out that Microsoft bought GitHub... ðŸ˜¢

I hope this is a good move for the team. That said, I don't know how to feel about this. I just hope they don't make it LinkedIn 2.0.
