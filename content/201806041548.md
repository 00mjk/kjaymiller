> As the first gen. Apple Watch was released in April of 2015, users will have had just under three and a half years running current software. This includes anyone who shelled out $10,000-$17,000 for an Apple Watch Edition.

I can use a 5 year old iPhone 5s with iOS11 (and the upcoming iOS12). 

To me I think this means that the watch innovation is moving at a faster rate than the iPhone at this point. I really wonder what that means for future iPhone releases and future watch releases.
