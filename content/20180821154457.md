There have been a few updates on the [Markdown Links (Reference Links) Action][1]for [Drafts][2]. 

## Reference Links
The action uses reference links to allow you to efficiently add links to your markdown content. I prefer Reference Links because it allows you to create more information to accurate describe your link.

## More Information Around Your Link
Now when you run the action, it will show you the text around the action as well. 

This will help create some context as to what the link should be outside of just the link text. (Great for when you make links like 
[This][3])

The [Markdown Links (Reference Links) Action][1] is available in the Draft Action Directory. 

I don't know what the next update will be, but I'm enjoying working on this action. 

If you have an action request, [let me know][4]!
