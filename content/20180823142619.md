The [Fill Markdown Links Draft Action (Reference Links)][1] v1.2.4 Update was bigger than I initially planned. 

I do believe there will only be a couple more updates before a major change. 

Ver. 1.2.4 Update:

- FIX: menu message now terminated on new lines. 
- FIX: resolved bug where sometimes updates would overwrite each other. 
- FIX: ensures that reference links and main content have a space between them. 
- FIX: Reference Links will continue sequence if other links already exist. 

The [Markdown Links (Reference Links) Action][1] is available in the Drafts Action Directory.
