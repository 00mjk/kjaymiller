My Friends over at [StaySorted.com][1] have released Sorted3 for iOS. 

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/5E1FEE47-91EA-4487-AA5E-3AFBDD0D4174.png)

To celebrate, I put together a [set of Draft Actions][2] that you can use to import Drafts into your Sorted Workflow.

## Adding Items
With [Add to Sorted][3] you can add an item to your inbox. If you select the [paste variant][4] you can paste your draft into the new task/event screen to take advantage of Sorted's natural language parsing for date selection. Lastly if you plan to do a lot of planning on a project you can make a list of items to be added in bulk.

## Time to Review
Sometimes you need to review your plans while you are working on something new. 

The [Open Sorted action][6] allows you to jump to Sorted directly from inside of Drafts. By default you go to the Today View, but there are variants to take you to the [Inbox][6] the [Search Screen][8] or a [specific date][9] that you can select beforehand.

All seven (7) of these actions are [available individually][11] and as a [group][2] in the Drafts Action Directory.  

If you have any requests for Draft Actions or other Automation help, you can [contact me][12] or subscribe to [my newsletter][13] which where I reveal my many adventures in Automation.
