Adding a task to a list is now possible with the [Add to Sorted Drafts][1] action. 

To add a list, just include a "#" with the list name IMMEDIATELY following it (No Space)

If the list name contains one or more spaces just surround the name with quotations (_#"Like This"_). 

The action can be added from the [Drafts action directory][1]. You can add it as a stand-alone action or a part of my [_Sorted 3 Action Group_][2]

If you have already downloaded it, you will need to do so again to receive the updated action. 

The [Drafts][3] and [Sorted][4] apps are both available in the iOS App Store.
