Folks that have followed my productivity _Journey_ üí© know that I'm a bullet journalist. Not that frilly stuff you see on Instagram but minimal multi-colored (for functionality) rapidlogging and tracking of things happening, have-happend and will happen in the near or distance future.

But I've noticed something in my perusing of the web. For the last few years many seem to think that Bullet Journaling has grown in popularity, but in fact a quick look at Google trends would show that while this January like every other one, there is a spike in people hoping to boost their productivity and break away from their phones and apps. This year, like the last, there was a significant dip showing that people are starting to lose interest and I think I have some ideas as to why.

## Influencer Lies and Advertising _Bye's_ üëãüèæ ##

My friend [Joe](https://twitch.tv/joebuhlig) used to gather our notebook friends around as we would rate whether or not the pictures of pages filled with washi tape, highlighters and _kawaii_ artwork counted as bullet journaling. While this may seem elitist we were actually look at the strategies these influencers were applying in hopes that there would be some secret technique unlocked.

There were many times where the notebooks that we observed were not only lacking any ot the BuJo fundamentals but also revealed these notebooks were also not being used for productivity. 

This leads me to believe that while my friends and I were looking for inspiration hoping to improve our productivity, others were diving deeper into their productivity porn-habit being fed to them by instagram and pinterest influencers.

Speaking of influencers, guess what also saw a major decrease... **Advertising Budgets**! This meant that influencers got paid less and my guess is when the checks stopped so did the amount of posts.

Sure there would still be those that were smart enough to create Etsy stores to build passive income, but one thing I've learned in my business as a side-hustler, You have to go where the money is and the money was leaving the analog space. 

## _You Can't_ Fallacies ##

I would wonder even if people weren't getting paid to bujo, would they. The short answer seems to be "No".

This is the same problem I have with "Traditional" productivity influencers.
