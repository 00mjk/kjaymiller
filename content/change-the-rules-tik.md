Looking at some of the evidence that has been brought against these companies is based on features that app authentication and hardware providers have made accessible to app developers. Examples include:

- Allowing third-party access to friend data
- Allowing connection between users in support requests
- Providing device and network tracking information

The thing about this that makes me upset is that these companies are playing by the rules and getting punished for it.

Like Tim Cook told Congress at the latest hearing. "If you don't like how we're doing things, change the rules."

I look forward to the investigation that will show that there are companies all over the world that are doing the same thing with the data that Facebook and other social media companies with "LogIn With..." functionality expose. 

## My Suggested Action

- Make it illegal for your data to be given to third parties without your explicit consent at the time of transfer.

I understand that technology using network and location data to surface relevant information is pushing innovation and allows for things like Uber and Yelp to work. However, I do think that this information should not be made available outside of the company.

## Why Won't They Do This?

I believe this will make it possible to surface ads based on information while making information about individuals protected against those that would benefit from it without the consent of the individual. 

It also creates a level of protection from our[^1] government as we would be notified when our information is given to law enforcement and surveillance organizations from companies. That is why this would never happen. In a world where governments are trying to pass laws to force backdoors into their encryption, no government wants to give up the right to spy on folks. 

In Short, America wants to spy on you. They just don't want others to do the same. ðŸ™ƒ
