Diversityorgs.tech allows guests to search for diversity-focused orgs in their area. We’ll look at web traffic and examine trends in orgs searched. I'll explain ingesting that data from NGINX logs using Beats. We’ll look at analytics from Elastic App Search and visualize this information with Kibana. Finally, we'll use that information to implement a new feature giving people requests based on their perceived area, ALL WHILE REQUIRING NO COOKIES OR TRACKING FROM OUR USERS."
