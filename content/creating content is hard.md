 It's been about a month since I made my last YouTube video. I've also started new projects with Conduit, and shut down some things.

This has been a challenge but I've learned some things in the last few days that I wanted to share.

## Starting New Projects are easier than ending them

It was [recently announced](https://twitter.com/clayrussell/status/1426279281622138889?s=20) that TekSide Network was going to be shutting down. This was an easy out for me because I was just a host but that's because I just loved getting on the conversation and having conversations with my co-hosts. I had no responsibility other than show up and play my role.

Shutting down PIT to start Conduit was not a mandatory thing, but it made sense. I wanted to make sure that my new project had the greatest opportunity for success. 

still The PIT show (and it's predecessor _Productivity in Tech Podcast_) was my brand. In fact my business is still called _Productivity in Tech_. 

## Experience: The Progress is Most Important

My Podcasting mentor, Myke Hurley mentioned once.

_Roughly Quoted..._

> You'll always shut something down much later than you should. It's better to do it when you think it's time. Eventually you will figure it out, through the failures not the successes.

**#MykewasRight**. So far Conduit has been the most engaging show I've made and I know that a part of it is the hard work that Kathy and I both put in not just on the recording but in between episodes. 

The show is a culmination of experience. Kathy works with plenty of folks helping them be more productive on a daily basis, while having to remain productive herself. My role is someone that has been talking to people about productivity and trying things for over a decade while trying to build my career as a developer and developer advocate.
