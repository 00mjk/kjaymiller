I had the privilege of being a guest on the [Focused Podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused/105).

I really enjoyed chatting with David and Mike and I've learned so much from
them in the past (Going all the way back to the Free Agent days). I'm happy I
was able to share some of my knowledge with their audience. 

Also, They will both be on the [Productivity in Tech
Podcast](https:podcast.productivityintech.com/subscribe) so subscribe today.
