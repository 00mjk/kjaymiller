In the past few weeks, I've been working on getting another (Yes another Podcast) up and running. In the spirit of "JUST DO IT ALREADY!!", I have launched the [*What I'm Podcast*][0]

The podcast is an extension of the "What I'm" Section on the home page. I've always liked letting people know what I've been up to and I hope with this I'll be able to flex my creativity muscles with this show.

[Episode 1][1] is up and I am putting together content to determine if this will be a weekly update or more frequently. 

I'm actively keeping this podcast off of major networks in effort to convice people that ultimately, you don't need to really on the heavy hitters like *Spotify* and *Apple*. You can subscribe via this [rss link](https://feeds.transistor.fm/what-i-m-podcast-with-jay-miller).
