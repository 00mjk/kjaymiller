I'm so confused. What are people yelling about. 
I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to have a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regards their benefit to an underrepresented group. 

The responses were:
- people praising OP for their bravery
- people shouting "What about candidate z?"
- people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do, not what they did do
- People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their position

The fear I have with this is that, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at and NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED. My Tho

I genuinely don't know why I even looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity.

My Anxiety is making me want to check out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networkings opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth all the people talking about things that I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. 

- Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity
- Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis
- Cats doing amazing tricks
- Videos of people failing so hard
- Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques
- Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle
- People motivation folks around them that are cry out for help
- People crying out for help!
- People that are so anti-professional that they are openly doubting their knowledge but still putting it out there because they hope people will support them.
- People building things to learn and are wanting feedback
- People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems

The guys at [Internet Friends](https://internetfriends.show) proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.

I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day. 

To expand on that, I would love it so that only you see the replies. If they are hateful you never hear from them again.

I've met so many wonderful people and seen so many wonderful things because of social media, but I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). I'm tired of being told to yell at people. I'm just SO TIRED. ðŸ˜­

Dear Social Media Companies:
	I don't care about followers anymore, I don't care about following. Platforms don't try and help me by injecting recommendations. Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line, but don't you realize the pain you cause people. Does that mean nothing to you. 

Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want quiet, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing all the wonderful people and benefits that social is the only way I can truly find. 

I literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occaisional life changing connections.

I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.

The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow milleneals. 

... OK BOOMER ...
