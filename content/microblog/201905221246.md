Two entries into my zshrc to make editing my two most edited config files easier on me. 

```
" Quickly open my zshrc
alias zshrc="nvim ~/.zshrc"

" Quickly Open my vimrc  ~NOTE: `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` is the default location for neovim (nvim)
" The default path for your .vimrc is ~/.vimrc

alias vimrc="nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim"
```
