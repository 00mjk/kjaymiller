title: Ask Me "What I'm ______!"
slug: what-im-question

If you have any questions for me. Just ask! 

You can have your question answered on the what I'm podcast by doing one of three things.

## 1. Via Twitter
[Tweet at me (@kjaymiller)](https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%40kjaymiller!%20%3CYOUR%20QUESTION%20HERE%3E%20%23whatim) with #whatim.

## 2. Via this convenient little form. 
This form will grant me 2 emails to you. One thanking you for the question and letting you know that I got it!

The other one is my answer. 

<form name="contact" netlify>
  <p>
      <label>Name <input type="text" name="name" /></label>
        </p>
	  <p>
	      <label>Email <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
	        </p>
	<p>
		<label>Your Question</lave>
<textarea name="question"></textarea>
</p>
		  <p>
		      <button type="submit">Send</button>
		        </p>
			</form>

I will ask if you want to join my newsletter in both emails, but if you say no or don't reply to either message, That's all you will here from me. (Unless I want you to be a guest on my SOLO SHOW to explain your question!)
