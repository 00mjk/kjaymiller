title: The What I'm Podcast"
slug: what-im-question

The What I'm podcast is a daily(ish) podcast where I just talk about what's been going on in the world and in my life.

### If you want to know what I'm up to. Just ask! 

You can have your question answered on the what I'm podcast by doing one of three things.

## 1. Via Twitter
[Tweet at me (@kjaymiller)](https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%40kjaymiller!%20%3CYOUR%20QUESTION%20HERE%3E%20%23whatim) with #whatim.

## 2. Via this convenient little form. 
This form will grant me **2** emails to you. 

One thanking you for the question and letting you know that I got it!

The other one is my answer. 

<form name="contact" netlify>
  <p>
      <label>Name <input type="text" name="name" /></label>
        </p>
	  <p>
	      <label>Email <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
	        </p>
	<p>
		<label>Your Question</lave>
<textarea name="question"></textarea>
</p>
		  <p>
		      <button type="submit">Send</button>
		        </p>
			</form>

I will ask if you want to join my newsletter in both emails. If you say no or don't reply to either message, that's all you will hear from me. _(Unless I want you to be a guest on my SOLO SHOW to explain your question!)_
