I'm happy to announce that the Productivity in Tech Podcast is back in action!

I was close to not publishing but I changed my mind after being scheduled to appear on two different podcasts. 

This Season (known as the 2020 Season) will be all about Me and My projects and productivity. 

The [first episode][episode-link] is out and you can listen on my [transistor page][episode-link] or in your podcast player.
