I got to be on a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKAeXtLv5-k) for [PythonBytes.fm](https://pythonbytes.fm/210)

Thanks to Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken for having me as a guest. We talked about some interesting picks around machine learning, circuitpy, and image optimization.

If you're looking for python news and recommendations, this is a great show to subscribe to.
