I was recently asked about the headache of re-writing things in my Bullet Journal. I have a really interesting trick in fixing that. 

I just do the task so I don't have to write it down more than once or twice. If I have to write it down more than twice, I really have to convince myself that is a task that is worth me thinking about at the moment to the point that I need to keep it in my notebook until it rears it's head again. 

This idea is similar to that of Mitch Hedberg's joke about convincing himself that a joke just wasn't that funny (Which now I can't seem to find so I have to believe that I have _Mandela Effected_ myself.) Similarly, I can often convince myself to just do the thing instead of writing it down for the _umpteenth_ time or I can just strike it and say, "This isn't important".
