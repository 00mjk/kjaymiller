            <p>Work in Progress means this Post is Mostly Done, but things could change. You can help with that by telling me your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1325700577033007104?s=21">twitter</a></p>

<p>I talked with a few friends this week and got some wonderful insights around podcasting and podcast marketing. </p>

<p>This is some next level advice from folks that use podcasting for at least part of their livelihood so if you're interested, listen up. </p>

<h3>Don't Just Wing It</h3>

<p>Would you believe I recorded the solo content for <a href="/the-power-of-personal-freedom-david-sparks-on-speaking-around-multiple-interests">this week's PIT Show</a> THREE DIFFERENT TIMES!?</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xIZku8V0y7uqk/source.gif" alt="waste time" /></p>

<p>I like to just do a thing without overthinking it. That doesn't mean that I should just get on the mic and start rambling (That's what twitter is for... ðŸ˜‰)</p>

<p>Even coming up with a quick 5-10 bullet outline can really make a difference in how focused content is.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/david-sparks-notes.jpeg?tr=pr-true,w-1024,h-500,fo-top" alt="David Sparks Episode Notes" /></p>

<h3>There is nothing wrong with doing a bunch of things that (seem the same).</h3>

<p>In my quest to figure out what's going on with my podcast ambitions, one of my concerns was that I would produce something that was the PIT Show but with a different name. The reality is that I want to do the PIT show but I want to be able to seperate it from the world of productivity and the world of development.</p>

<p>The tech industry is dominated by companies that pitch themselves with "It's like <em>X</em> but <em>Y</em>". I feel like I can channel that to make some really good shows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One I'm thinking of off the top of my head is the <em>AntiProductivity Show</em> (Working Title) where I talk with folks that play with Productivity tools to discover the weaknesses in their systems. It's like a productivity show but honest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Half of my listeners are <em>tech workers</em> that are interested in productivity. The other half are <em>tech enthusiasts</em> that like my spin on productivity (or lack therof and my interviews).</p>

<h3>Limited Run Shows are great! There will be a lot of those in my future!</h3>

<p>One of the things I'm doing in my day job is working to come up with seasonal and limited run content. These would be interview series and YouTube things.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of limited run and narrow focused content. Being able to do things where that are super concentrated (in theory) should allow me to have smaller but more focused audiences that will come to grow the network around me. This means that over time, people will not come for the shows and instead will come to support the work that I put out. It also means that I don't have to feel bad if every project doesn't satisfy everyone in my audience. I can put out the things I want to put out and only continue the things that have enough support to expand on it. </p>

<h3>Cut a Demo</h3>

<p>Whether you are pitching a project to a major network or just planning your next project, be sure to record a few demos. These will not see the light of day but they are a good way to get in the groove. </p>

<p>It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to give you and others an idea for what the plan is. This will help you find your show's voice better and give you something to pass to friends so that they can tell you it's a great idea!!</p>

<h3>Always Leave Them Wanting Something (to eat?)</h3>

<p>Another way to word this is that you don't have to let out EVERYTHING in one recording. Some of the best conversations I've had with folks started with a rather vague or snippet of a thought and then evolved into a larger examination into the subject.</p>

<p>I talk too much. The word count on this proves that. In fact this entire post was a newsletter email at first and turned into the first TIFOTR and this post when I realized that no one wants to have 1500 words sitting in their inbox. </p>

<p>That's another thing give them what they want. </p>

<p>Here is an example on that idea.</p>

<p>You are podcasting about an idea like, "<em>Why Cheesecake is the best pie ever</em>" (Fight me!). In the episode, you mention the variety of cheesecakes, the creaminess and the ease of preparation and cost (about 10 minutes). You could share some of your favorite recipes but instead you decide to make that a blog post (about 500 words and some good links ðŸ˜‹). Lastly, in a newsletter post you mention why cheesecake isn't a cake and link to your thoughts while inviting your subscribers to try and convince you otherwise. (a quick 100 words)</p>

<p>In this way you've gotten all your thoughts out, but you left your audiences wanting to engage you on the subject and a few places to start.</p>

<p>BTW I don't have a post on cheesecake and I would be fine with a frozen one from the local grocer, but those are my thoughts and those of a few friends and now you have them ðŸ˜„.</p>
