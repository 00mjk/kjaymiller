<title>Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently been doing weekly reviews with my wife (GTD addicts calm down, not that kind of review). Mostly we just cover my schedule and plan our meals for the week. This has been amazing for us as it gets us on the same page and eliminates any last minute decisions. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not always thinking about what my wife has on her schedule. So this allows me to check the <em>Family Calendar</em> and make sure that anything that will impact the family or our routine is on there. I also put our weekly meal plan in OmniFocus with the tag: <em>Dinner</em>.</p>

<title>How Can White People Help Black People. What is the Real Problem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from a personal conversation I had.</p>
<p>Not to be the Subject matter black guy or anything but a couple of years of research and several years of living has taught me this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.</li>
<li>There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.</li>
<li>We can't blame "fathers not being in the homes". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.</li>
<li>White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>My thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these "Dangerous" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years</p>
<h3>How Do You Fix Number 2?</h3>
<p>Make education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.</p>
<p>As someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.</p>
<p>My chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.</p>
<p>I will put it clearly...</p>
<p><strong>HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.</strong></p>
<p>It won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>We can't pull ourselves up by our bootstraps if we can't afford boots.</em>" - Someone that at one point couldn't afford boots.</p>

<title>[Podcast] Ask a Brit Ep 4: I don&#39;t know who that is!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I ask Jamie if the UK is still the beacon of world pop culture?</p>]]></description>

<link>https://kjaymiller.com/podcast_ask_a_brit_ep_4:_i_don&#39;t_know_who_that_is</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 20:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">podcast_ask_a_brit_ep_4:_i_don&#39;t_know_who_that_is</guid></item><item>
<title>Can we fix this?</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been mostly silent in this time, mostly as I needed time to think
about what I would like to see come out of all this.</p>
<h2>How to Fix Racism</h2>
<p>Racism is all over the world. Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.</p>
<p>I don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and
become equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.
Instead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust
punishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never
able to gain any amount of legitimate growth.</p>
<p>Force the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that
are disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest
person of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the
only one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>If you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely
(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for
you.</p>
<h2>On Rioting</h2>
<p>In my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.
Furthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me
from my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked
to be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and
the fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint
and had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took
them from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the
age of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop
car over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,
uneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you
have pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local
communities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation
of Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict
government oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.</p>
<p>It took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is
founded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we
murdered until we got it.</p>
<p>We did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to
ourselves (see civil war).</p>
<p>Now when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our
nation call us Terrorists.</p>
<p>While I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and
maintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying
the example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those
that murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while
the rest of society looked away.</p>
<h2>On The Legal System</h2>
<p>In regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who
have the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout
my wishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down</li>
<li>More racial and gender diversity in police forces</li>
<li>Mandatory implicit bias checks and training</li>
<li>Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making
  an arrest.</li>
<li>The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how
they can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that
can't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up
for themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly. And be willing to listen when we do speak up.</p>]]></description>

<title>In Defense of the Black Multi-Potentialite</title>  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Stay in Your Lane.</em> - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors<br><br></p>
<p><em>Shut up and Dribble.</em> - Laura Ingraham<br><br></p>
<p><em>Why does every black actor gotta rap some. I don't know. All I know is I'm the best one.</em> - Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino.<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.</p>
<p>For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.</p>
<p>For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. </p>
<p>I joined the Marine Corps.</p>
<h3>But Why</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
If not himself, then he has naught<br>
To say the things he truly feels<br>
And not the words of one who kneels<br>
The record shows, I took the blows<br>
And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. </p>
<p>In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.</p>
<p>When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).</p>
<p>In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.</p>
<h3>I do a lot.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I work a Day job.</li>
<li>I manage a <a href="https://productivityintech.com">side business</a> helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller">write code</a>.</li>
<li>I host a range of <a href="/podcasts">podcasts</a> from tech to gaming.</li>
<li>I'm a member of an Esports organization and <a href="https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller">stream regularly</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>My coding skills help me automate and optimize my day job. My day job skills,
challenge me to think differently and shake up stale thought. My podcasting and
streaming skills gave me the ability to identify ways that I could help my
side-business clients in their content-creating journey.</p>
<p>They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. </p>
<p>I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. </p>
<p>Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.</p>
<p>Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.</p>
<p>My child will grow up one seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.</p>]]></description>

<title>Quickly Set Your Environment with Bunch and Alfred</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/">Bunch</a> is an environment setup/teardown tool by the <a href="https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/episodes/podcast-ground-surfing-with-brett-terpstra">mad genius and yoga maestro of the internet</a> Brett Terpstra.</p>
<p>Bunch uses small configuration files to quickly manipulate your desktop environment. </p>
<p>With it you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open/Close/Focus Applications, Files, and URLs</li>
<li>Run shell and Applescript scripts to expand the functionality event more</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard and the Application's main method of use is the Dock, I opted to take advantage of Bunch's URL-Scheme. </p>
<p><code>x-bunch://open?bunch=[Bunch Name]</code></p>
<p>This plus smart use of the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/"><em>File Filter</em></a> in Alfred's workflow feature allowed me to quickly setup an <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Alfred Workflow</a> that not only lets you run your bunches but also lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the Config File of the Bunch.</li>
<li>Edit the Bunch in your default application.</li>
<li>Refresh your Bunches (After making a change)</li>
</ul>
<p>The workflow is available on <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/bunch-quick-launch">Packal</a> to modify via my <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Github Repo</a></p>]]></description>

<title>My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been on a tear with new podcasts, live streams, and communities.</p>
<p>My secret is these are all <em>cries for help</em>. </p>
<p>Not in a life threatening way, but in the stuck in an axiety induced feedback loop. </p>
<p><img alt="Questionable Content Comic by Jeph Jacques" src="https://questionablecontent.net/comics/3953.png" /></p>
<p>I've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more <em>fatalistic</em> and irrational towards things not going according to plan. </p>
<h3>Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?</h3>
<p><em>HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW</em></p>
<p>It just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. </p>
<p>I will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.</p>
<h3>Why are you telling us this?</h3>
<p>I'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. </p>
<p>It took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<p>I understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.</p>
<p>I can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. </p>

<title>Introducing the What I&#39;m Podcast!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the past few weeks, I've been working on getting another (Yes another Podcast) up and running. In the spirit of "JUST DO IT ALREADY!!", I have launched the <a href="https://kjaymiller.transistor.fm"><em>What I'm Podcast</em></a></p>
<p>The podcast is an extension of the "What I'm" Section on the home page. I've always liked letting people know what I've been up to and I hope with this I'll be able to flex my creativity muscles with this show.</p>
<p><a href="https://kjaymiller.transistor.fm/episodes/i-ve-been-sick-i-must-have-caught-the-apple-bug">Episode 1</a> is up and I am putting together content to determine if this will be a weekly update or more frequently. </p>
<p>I'm actively keeping this podcast off of major networks in effort to convice people that ultimately, you don't need to really on the heavy hitters like <em>Spotify</em> and <em>Apple</em>. You can subscribe via this <a href="https://feeds.transistor.fm/what-i-m-podcast-with-jay-miller">rss link</a>. </p>

<title>Announcing Transcriptor</title>  <description><![CDATA[<h2>This was the launch month for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor">Transcriptor</a>. This is a helper package that I use for doing transcriptions for PIT Clients.</h2>
<p>Transcriptions can be accomplished in a plethora of ways, but in order to do it, you need to have a good idea of how to work with the results from your transcription engine. While I usually use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a>, I have used <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/">Google Could Services Speech to Text</a> and I would love to look into the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.Ai</a>. All of these systems use their own schema for your task and your results.</p>
<p>The goal of transcriptor is to create a single Job object that is responsible (currently) for handling the results in a consistent object-oriented way. By using it, I've been able to create some clarity in my coding projects for folks and reduced the amount of copying and pasting across the board.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Can you use it?</em> <strong>At your own risk, sure.</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it documented?</em> <strong>Not Yet</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it stable?</em> <strong>I wouldn't say that...</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it open source?</em> <strong>Of course it is!</strong></li>
<li><em>Am I accepting contributions</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>I am accepting testing and documentation PRs, I'm also looking at incoming issues and If you have a fix (Not a Feature Request), I will accept after testing and reviews.</p>]]></description>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the Quarantine, I've been goign on two weekly walks with a couple of PIT
Premium Members.</p>
<p>This allows me to do a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Catch up/Learn more with members of my community</li>
<li>Get some exercise</li>
<li>Vent about whatever it is I need to vent about.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been struggling to keep weight off as my asthma has been worsening with
the weight gain. If my friends are not available, I tend to take this route
with my headphones in and use the time to decompress or just think about
things. Also the time away from my computer really helps.</p>

<title>Friends have been my Greatest Asset!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been letting folks know about my <a href="https://productivityintech.com/coaching">coaching</a> and <a href="https://productivityintech.com/editing">editing</a> services more and more these days. </p>
<p>It's been a slow progressing growth. This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. </p>
<h2>Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.</h2>
<p>I've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. </p>
<p>100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis <strong>or</strong> they were recommended by the aforementioned person.</p>
<p>While I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.</p>
<p>I know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. </p>
<h2>Ways to do this</h2>
<h3>1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg" />
<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small></p>
<p>One of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. </p>
<p>Each of them have their own reach and their own network. 
I've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. </p>
<p>I've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. </p>
<h3>2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method</h3>
<p>Some relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the <a href="https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/">Noguchi Filing Method</a>. </p>
<p>The Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. 
<img alt="" src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg" /></p>
<p>I do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. </p>
<h3>3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)</h3>
<p>I got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)</p>
<p>Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and "unicorn" services.</p>
<p>I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. </p>
<p>Here is a list of the services I provide.</p>
<p>My skills include:
- social media
- recording videos and screencasts
- podcast editing and recording
- community management
- newsletter publishing</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?</p>
<p>Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. </p>
<p>I didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.</p>
<p>One person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.</p>
<p>The other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. </p>
<p>================</p>
<p>None of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this <em>grimy</em> feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your "inner-circle" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.</p>]]></description>

<title>January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year I made the decision to go full time analog productivity. To me this was a return to my <em>Midori Traveller's Notebook</em> and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. </p>
<p>With January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. </p>
<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>Since I've been reading [<em>The Bullet Journal Method</em>][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. </p>
<p>This time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in <em>Marie Kondo</em> style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were "essential" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. </p>
<p>With the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.</p>
<p>Another big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  </p>
<h3>What didn't go so well</h3>
<p>There is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. </p>
<p>Another failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. </p>
<h3>My thoughts going into February</h3>
<p>February is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.</p>]]></description>

<title>Fish Resources</title>  <description><![CDATA[<div class="notification is-dark">
<div class="content">
<h2 class="has-text-light">Update:</h2>
<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I do a lot of work in the terminal. I understand that for many it's the lack of glitz and glamour that keeps people away from it, and while the majority of my computer usage is in some GUI, there are still many things that I can do much faster using a script that I can launch from my terminal.</p>
<p>Fish (Short for Friendly Interactive Shell) was a great attempt to add some modern-ness to the terminal environment. That said it has been around since the 90's as this boutique experience that some love, many ignore, and even more fear. </p>
<p>Well, fear not. Here are a few links that can help introduce you to fish and help you get out the gate quickly.</p>

<title>I Can&#39;t Be the Only One Seeing This</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>What are people yelling about?</p>
<p>I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to give a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regarding how their policy affected underrepresented groups. </p>
<p>The responses were:</p>
<ul>
<li>people praising the OP for their bravery</li>
<li>people shouting "What about candidate z?"</li>
<li>people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do</li>
<li>People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their own agenda</li>
</ul>
<p>The fear I have is, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at. In the end NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED.</p>
<p>I don't even know looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity? ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><img alt="My thoughts" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZbUOH7pbDiNSmU1x4o/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>I'm considering checking out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networking opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth dealing with the things I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. </p>
<ul>
<li>Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity</li>
<li>Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis</li>
<li>Cats doing amazing tricks</li>
<li>Videos of people failing so hard</li>
<li>Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques</li>
<li>Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle</li>
<li>People motivation folks around them that are crying out for help</li>
<li>People crying out for help!</li>
<li>People that are openly doubt their knowledge but are still putting themselves out there because they hope people will support them.</li>
<li>People building things to learn and are wanting feedback</li>
<li>People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The guys at <a href="https://internetfriends.show">Internet Friends</a> proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.</p>
<p>"I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day."</p>
<p>To expand on that, I would love it so that you can only see the replies. If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.</p>
<p>I've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). </li>
<li>I'm tired of being told to yell at people. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just SO TIRED. 😭</p>
<p>Dear Social Media Companies:
    I don't care about followers anymore.</p>
<pre><code>Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration.

I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line.

Don't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?
</code></pre>
<p>Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. </p>
<p>I'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.</p>
<p>I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.</p>
<p>The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. </p>
<p>... OK BOOMER ...</p>]]></description>

<title>May 2020 - Monthly Catchup</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is also available via my <a href="https://buttondown.email/productivityintech">Newsletter</a>.</em></p>
<h1>Monthly Catchup</h1>
<p>Speaking of Ketchup, here are some <a href="https://sharedappetite.com/recipes/10-creative-artisan-ketchup-flavors/">Artisan Ketchup Ideas</a>.</p>
<h2>Productivity in Tech Podcast</h2>
<p>This month on the <a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5">PIT Podcast</a> I interviewed my good internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl">Christina Morrillo</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5"><img alt="pit podcast" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/pit-v3.jpg" /></a></p>
<h2>The Biz</h2>
<p>Business has been good. I'll be talking about this in my <a href="https://buttondown.email/pitpremium">premium newsletter</a> where I break down how I run my business, the workflows the code, the everything (but the clients). </p>
<h2>Productivity</h2>
<p>"<em>In these Troubled Times</em>" 🤮</p>
<p>Just Kidding. Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. </p>
<p>I've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.</p>
<p>This Month, I purchased <a href="https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a>. I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other <a href="https://devontechnologies.com">DevonTechnologies</a> Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the <a href="https://www.tekside.net/tektok/2020/5/12/hl180iov0tpnl3rs0jlbu8q1efb0yu">TekTok Podcast</a> to join me on it.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Render Engine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/all_posts">personal blog</a></li>
<li>Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.</li>
<li>Support for Categories and Tags</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transcriptor</h3>
<p>I launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/announcing_transcriptor">announcement post</a>, to learn more. </p>
<h3>Episde-DL</h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/">Episode-DL</a> is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.</p>
<h3>Following Me</h3>
<p>You can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
