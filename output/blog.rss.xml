<title>January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year I made the decision to go full time analog productivity. To me this was a return to my <em>Midori Traveller's Notebook</em> and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. </p>

<p>With January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. </p>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<p>Since I've been reading [<em>The Bullet Journal Method</em>][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. </p>

<p>This time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in <em>Marie Kondo</em> style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were "essential" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. </p>

<p>With the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.</p>

<p>Another big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  </p>

<h3>What didn't go so well</h3>

<p>There is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. </p>

<p>Another failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. </p>

<h3>My thoughts going into February</h3>

<p>February is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.</p>

<h2>Auto-Generated Transcription</h2>

<p>Jay 00:00:17:</p>

<p>lots of everybody. J. Miller here back with another productivity in tech podcast. I hope you're having a fantastic week and mine just got a little bit better because I have the wonder and privilege to talk to someone that I have known for</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:36:</p>

<p>God like six years now And one of the first people I met when I became a programmer Ah always brings a smile to my face to see them Talks are absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And also just a generally overall just glowing person. Not because the radioactive, but because they just know how to brighten up a room. I am talking with the one the only Melanie crutch build. Melanie is so good to see you.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:09:</p>

<p>Wow, I The glowing, I think is like I think this is just fire of, like, embarrassment on my face now because you know</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:19:</p>

<p>the first of a nice say, like San Diego wildfires like G, it's like, well, not really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:24:</p>

<p>know Now I think it</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:26:</p>

<p>started. I guess so,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're we're hanging in there so far like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:33:</p>

<p>it's funny. It didn't quite into my consciousness that we have like yet another plague that we could layer onto 2020 like he's, you know, like of the seven layer salad of For that, 2020 is becoming like fires. I almost forgot, J thank you.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:54:</p>

<p>Under, I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:55:</p>

<p>guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:57:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:58:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bless it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jay 00:02:00:</p>

<p>Yes. So other than the obvious, um, perils that air plaguing America right now. How have you been? Generally?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:12:</p>

<p>Uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:13:</p>

<p>yeah. Well,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:16:</p>

<p>um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:18:</p>

<p>okay, so my my measurements of how I'm doing might be slightly different than the average person. Like if I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:30:</p>

<p>and awake</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:32:</p>

<p>and I have clothes on my body Bonus bonus. Both of those air working today, I have fed my cells.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:41:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:44:</p>

<p>yeah, and I got a couple of things done today. I mean, that's like, I'm like, living my best life</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:50:</p>

<p>at that point.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:54:</p>

<p>because, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:56:</p>

<p>it is, uh, often that those are not my days. You know, um, that they don't quite look like that because of, um because I have major depressive disorder. Um, I also have, like a really fun and exciting relationship with migraines, So there's that I have the anxiety. I have epilepsy, which is is fun,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:23:</p>

<p>that it's well controlled, so it's not as it's not as interesting or imitating as it might be. otherwise so, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:31:</p>

<p>but the, you know, the depression really gives you a completely different, um, scale of success,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:38:</p>

<p>I guess. Is what what I might call it. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:43:</p>

<p>as someone who often has to tell people in social environments of like, hey, if I start laughing really hard, can you just make sure I don't collapse? Um, I can relate. Um, that has the last few years ever since, you know, cardiac episode after cardiac episode,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:02:</p>

<p>you do start to take a lot of things that other people I guess we take for granted. You, like, treat them as this has been a good day. I haven't blacked out in five days like OK, that is that is like an awesome feeling. All</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:17:</p>

<p>right.</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:17:</p>

<p>So I can I can totally relate</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:21:</p>

<p>to where you're coming from their Well,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:24:</p>

<p>do me a favor, because I know you well, but the people listening to the show probably don't know you as well as ideo. So kind of Introduce yourself. Let people know who you are, what you do and, uh, ultimately like, what brings you joy in the tech space?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:42:</p>

<p>Oh, good gracious. OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:43:</p>

<p>just some smiles, you know?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:45:</p>

<p>Yeah, Just anybody stuff? Um, let's see. I am a python and jingle developer.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:53:</p>

<p>Um, I am self taught. I went to two years of college and then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:01:</p>

<p>didn't go to college after that. Which they still turned you for. Interestingly love? Um, yeah. Uh, wow. Yeah. And spread this whole different thing. But private school is a racket. I don't know why you do that. Um, yes. So I did that I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:20:</p>

<p>and then much later in life, I got into development because it is fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:26:</p>

<p>Um, I started out like my professional life was in fine art photographic printing. So I had about a decade of, ah, life in the art world there, which makes it sound much sexier than it was. Um, although it was fun and good, like, that was a good time. And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:46:</p>

<p>I had my first daughter and kind of rejected out of the job, seen for a while. And when I came back,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:54:</p>

<p>I wanted to do something that, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:57:</p>

<p>compensated for my time in a in a decent way, you know, especially living in San Diego. Um, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:07:</p>

<p>I just thought, you know, I had done I have done some little like apple script scripts. Do you know what this thing is? What? Apples with this? Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:17:</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:17:</p>

<p>get a few of them. Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:20:</p>

<p>usually ones that turn my mic off because I am notorious for, like, ending a conversation being done and then later on, just being like, Oh, the recording still going And then like having three hours of just dead audio toe toe work on?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:36:</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, it's just a little fiddly stuff like that. And so I am. I made some scripts, like, way back</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:45:</p>

<p>many, many years ago. I don't know, 15 years ago or something, And, uh</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:50:</p>

<p>so when I was trying to figure out where am I gonna go now with my career and loves, like, you know, I had fun with that. I'm one,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:59:</p>

<p>you know, making computers do stuff. Like maybe I could do some of that same born, um, and then came, you know, in my learning process came across the python community in San Diego and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:11:</p>

<p>that was it. That's how I am. Kind of got my heat settled.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:17:</p>

<p>So, um, I work in a rightly or really not the car shop, as we were discussing earlier. Um, although I have repaired my car in a variety of ways on my own.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:29:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:31:</p>

<p>it still works. It still runs Most of the things we're still on there. It does have a weird rattle. Um, anyway, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:39:</p>

<p>and my little side projects five up is still</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:44:</p>

<p>up and running.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:46:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:48:</p>

<p>that's me. I have two kids. I'm cat</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:51:</p>

<p>E, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:53:</p>

<p>But I think that's it. The end. Is there more? What else should I say?</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:58:</p>

<p>No, that's it. That's good podcast. No, no, we're gonna look, look, goingto a lot of more detail than that, but but yeah, let's let's start with you know, one of the things that you just brought up was</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:11:</p>

<p>you wanted to do a job that you felt you were being compensated for. I guess I would say as fairly as</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:22:</p>

<p>weird systems that can</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:25:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're not gonna go into that conversation. That's another podcast. But, ah, the big thing was, it wasn't, You know, development wasn't something that you were like.</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:36:</p>

<p>Hey, I'm, like, 14 and hacking in tow. You know, the U S treasury and I've always been a programmer, and like, it wasn't like this whole crazy lifestyle thing for Yeah, I was like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:50:</p>

<p>Here's a small piece of my life that I do that</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:54:</p>

<p>I mean, it be cool if I got paid to do this. I mean, like that. That's a really</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:59:</p>

<p>interesting approach, because it kind of goes against what everybody is taught. You know, when you go to high school, you have to do like, Oh, yeah, you know, you need to go to the best school toe, get into engineering or get into our did to get into all these things. And it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:16:</p>

<p>or you could just live your life, do the things that you enjoy doing and then find something in that realm that actually gives you a paycheck and then do that and then in your free time, make really cool stuff like five up, which we're gonna talk about later. Um, so So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool. Did you find a challenge? Ah, like, did you find it challenging to get into the tech space, Not having the I went toe Caltech or m I t. And you know up. You know, I was born with a keyboard in my hand, like that whole mindset.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:55:</p>

<p>it's tricky because I feel like not having those types of credentials.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:06:</p>

<p>I still like it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:08:</p>

<p>It affects me like it means more to me than it does to other people. You know, I'm</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:16:</p>

<p>I'm grateful. I mean, that's from my experience. Like, I'm grateful that I hade, um, the experience of applying to Riley in working through that process and not</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:31:</p>

<p>not having the pressure to have some sort of pedigree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:36:</p>

<p>in intact.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:39:</p>

<p>So I didn't experience that, But it is always really interesting to talk, Teoh. Other folks that do you have an experience? I was talking to someone the other day who was mentioning that, um, it just so happened that in there, like a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:59:</p>

<p>computer science class that they had,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:03:</p>

<p>they're like senior year in high school, which, first of all, ending a farming town.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:09:</p>

<p>We had f A like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:12:</p>

<p>also way.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:14:</p>

<p>The way that my life shook out. I only I graduated early, surly had, like, one semester of my senior year. And then I went and, like, works in a coffee shop after that, you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:25:</p>

<p>our situations were like small time, different So but he,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:30:</p>

<p>you know, was saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:33:</p>

<p>in my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:34:</p>

<p>in my a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:36:</p>

<p>CS class.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:39:</p>

<p>The teacher happens to know, like the super good friends that someone high up in, you know, X y z tech, like in a huge tech company. And so this BP or whatever from this big tech company comes in and does like, practice interviews with every limits in the class. They're seniors, the high school, they're like 17. You know what I'm saying? Like were 18 or however old they are. They're teenagers, though, for sure. So there's these</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:07:</p>

<p>teenagers. Some of them then got jobs like straight out of high school.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:13:</p>

<p>It's like I was just kind of like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:17:</p>

<p>whoa,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:19:</p>

<p>you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:20:</p>

<p>and I know that, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:24:</p>

<p>you know, you were saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:26:</p>

<p>a second ago like we don't want to get into the whole, like, inequality and what's like, you know, fair compensation and stuff.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:33:</p>

<p>Um, but it is just kind of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:36:</p>

<p>it is kind of mind blowing, right that some people do walk into the tech space saying, you know, I have</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:44:</p>

<p>I have all these credentials. I have all these this experiments, you know, and I'm like one of the computer stuff, but which I did.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:55:</p>

<p>I did have a continuing everyone Yeah, yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:13:01:</p>

<p>I've played Tetris super good at it</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:05:</p>

<p>for me. I always hesitate, you know, toe to talk about kind of the entrance into the tech space, Um, from any level of knowledge, because I technically haven't entered the development space working on it trying really am. But, you know, it is interesting to hear, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:27:</p>

<p>the conversation of</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:30:</p>

<p>you have a perfect example</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:33:</p>

<p>giving a resume to someone or like this, presenting a resume to a company and, like having two people</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:40:</p>

<p>look at your resume and tell you to conflicting things like one is like, Oh, you need to focus on your projects more because you don't have the job experience and one says, Oh, but your other job experience is super relatable for a higher management position, so you should focus on that more, and it's like, Okay, I have one person telling me to put my job experience at the front. The other one told me to put my projects at the front. I can't put them both there like I need writing something. So it it's always interesting to hear the idea of like</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:11:</p>

<p>it can't be this hard</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:13:</p>

<p>for everybody, and it's not necessarily.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:18:</p>

<p>You know, I don't have a solution for that, but I would just I love hearing people address that, like OK, yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:26:</p>

<p>For some people, it was extremely easy for others. It was a little bit harder. And then for some, they're still trying to get their foot in the door. Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:36:</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, I'm glad for some of the people who have</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:41:</p>

<p>gone through whatever they did,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:44:</p>

<p>because now they know what it took, which means they're willing to help other people not have to go through that same thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:52:</p>

<p>Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:53:</p>

<p>And I have to say, like, you know, I worked hard. I tried to learn, I went to conferences and, you know, I built my thing, and I did</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:04:</p>

<p>Those couple of talks like, I put time and energy into it,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:11:</p>

<p>but I knew someone. I honestly think that networking is huge,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:19:</p>

<p>which is also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:23:</p>

<p>just a huge, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:27:</p>

<p>playground for injustice</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:30:</p>

<p>right</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:30:</p>

<p>now</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:32:</p>

<p>because not everybody knows. Well, it I guess the hard part is, is like, if you know someone, you could get a foot in the door. But like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:41:</p>

<p>the people that don't know anyone have a problem And then there's also like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:46:</p>

<p>the We don't want to punish you for bringing in the wrong people kind of feeling that they come that comes with it. Like I I see so many people of color that air in</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:58:</p>

<p>management levels that work with no other people of color. And it's just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:05:</p>

<p>I mean, I'm glad you're not like using it as a way to, like, bring just anybody in. But at the same time, it seems really weird that, like there's not one and it and it's because of that. It's like, Well, if I</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:20:</p>

<p>What if I make a mistake? What if I I have a bad higher and they happen to be a person of color? And then now you're making the problem even worse and even harder for other people in it. It's like again,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:33:</p>

<p>I just wish that it wasn't this hard for everyone and that they didn't have to go to sleep, you know, worrying about their job because they hired someone that they know is capable of doing the work. But because of how they look, you know, it could be a problem. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:46:</p>

<p>ultimately, I don't think that the conversation we're gonna have here is probably gonna solve that problem. But I do hope that someone listening, uh, maybe you can, you know, solve a smaller problem like that and you know your own little world.</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:02:</p>

<p>But you talked about</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:05:</p>

<p>you know, you</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:06:</p>

<p>all the things that you did Do you know, aside from knowing someone like you gave the talks, you built the thing. Like when I first met you,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:17:</p>

<p>I was trying to build a thing</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:19:</p>

<p>and, like, I had no clue what I was doing. And I think, um, a good like, a couple of mutual friends of ours were just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:27:</p>

<p>I mean, this is a cool idea. What are you doing</p>

<p>Melanie 00:17:31:</p>

<p>on? I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:33:</p>

<p>I I had probably I'd probably been using Python for maybe, like, a week and 1/2. So it was like, I have an exact problem. I've solved it in kind of this really ugly way. Now I want to take it to the next step and solve it in a slightly less ugly way. And in doing that, I just kind of screwed it up. But I'm going to talk about your</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:56:</p>

<p>Django app that just brings joy into the world and phones of people. So I'm just gonna I'm going to just sit back and let you just talk about about the app. Talk about the idea for it. Talk about you know what it's been like running it for as long as you've been running. I can't I can't imagine. Like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:16:</p>

<p>I don't think I have anything that's been in the wild for, like, more than a year.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:22:</p>

<p>Yeah. Um, so</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:25:</p>

<p>five opap dot com</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:27:</p>

<p>It's a Django out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:29:</p>

<p>Um, it is not a phone app. I have to say the whole I was just thinking about this today. I think five up dot com was taken. And so I think that's where I went with five. Look after Tom. But to non tech people, like they're like, what's the thing that I download in the night? Just have to say, I'm sorry I made a thing that's confusing. Just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:51:</p>

<p>just ignore that for a second and felt the form and give me all of your personal contact information.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:57:</p>

<p>And then something good is gonna happen. Trust possibly did. Yeah. I mean, I'm a random person on the Internet. Why not? You know. So, um, yes. So what it does is it sends happy texts every day. That's its only function. That's all it does. I got the idea. It's build it because I actually, um the first, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:23:</p>

<p>class that I took on python was through Udacity. And they have this bit in there Where you, um you had to make a little bit of a project using Tulio.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:39:</p>

<p>Um and so I had done, like, I had kind of come up with this idea of, like, isn't that when that be nice to just get happened? Texts</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:48:</p>

<p>And part of the idea between our for sending five texts, which is what it was initially that you could only get five, and that was it. Like you're gonna have a quantity of five. Happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:01:</p>

<p>We're guard lis of what you like. That's what you're getting. Um, but the idea is there's some research that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:11:</p>

<p>maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Whatever. Um, but this concept that need 3 to 5 positive things to outweigh each negatives thing that happens to you. So the idea is like, I'm kind of betting on a negative thing, but you every day. But I mean, if you end up with a surplus of happy. It's fine. It's time</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:36:</p>

<p>not to be upset about it. So eventually I changed it so that you can choose</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:42:</p>

<p>1234 or five per day</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:46:</p>

<p>because people were like, it's too happy</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:48:</p>

<p>saying they were actually just like is like a really, really happy person around you and your like, you're just annoying. Now. I'm sorry. Like I love the people are friendly and something is working well for you, but if you could do it away from me, that would be wonderful. So, um, video just a little bit of happened. Just one.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:08:</p>

<p>yeah, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:11:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:12:</p>

<p>So I came to the Python meet up with this, you know, kind of baby idea, this python script, Um, and then someone was like, oh, built the Django</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:22:</p>

<p>and I was like, all right, you know, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:26:</p>

<p>and then it was just like months of being like I don't know what I'm doing at all and just going home and, like, suffering through, you know, trying to go through this development process and figure it was going on like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:43:</p>

<p>I didn't know it at the time, and I do now. It's kind of both comforting and in infuriating that like hours, hours, and hours, days, weeks of developers time are spent over, like a semi colon in the wrong place. You know, like just a single character, you know, or just this, these the tiniest thing. So, you know, I went two months of that and then eventually got it somewhat working. It was very buggy at first. Um, it is still kind of bugging. Actually Had someone report above a couple weeks ago, and I I almost have it. Thanks, but, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:27:</p>

<p>you know, life, but whatever.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:30:</p>

<p>We need bugs in life, I guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:33:</p>

<p>Yeah. I mean...No.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:36:</p>

<p>no, I got in your gardens</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:40:</p>

<p>right there. Get in the garden. I always try to do that. Things I have young kids, you know where you're like. Let me spine</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:46:</p>

<p>finds him to be grateful for about that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:51:</p>

<p>bugs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:52:</p>

<p>reminds us that we're fallible or something. I</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:57:</p>

<p>Oh, that's that's too funny, though. And I love that, like, again. A lot of the story that came from from this was</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:08:</p>

<p>a level of like, I understand that that life sucks at times.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:13:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:15:</p>

<p>at best I'm I'm leveling the playing field or I guess it. At worst, I'm leveling the playing field That best I'm giving you, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:24:</p>

<p>extra happy. Which to me, that is That is like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:30:</p>

<p>a lot of people know, like my favorite</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:33:</p>

<p>personality in the entire world is the late, great Bob Ross, and it was just like nobody on the planet should ever be. This happy like the guy, like adopt squirrels. It's,</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:48:</p>

<p>I think, of the some of the greatest people that have ever lived. Like Nikola Tesla apparently married a pigeon like there's just a level of coziness that just comes with being</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:01:</p>

<p>an amazing person. And I think that if you could be crazily like happy and just want other people to be justice crazily happy as you like that is the best possible outcome because the</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:18:</p>

<p>the worst</p>

<p>Melanie 00:24:18:</p>

<p>side of that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:19:</p>

<p>like serial killer. So it's like extremely happy sociopath. Serial killer. Where on the spectrum are you and right? So I love that one that you're using your coding skills for good and not sociopathic serial killer. He stuff,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, but also that</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:39:</p>

<p>you pushed through because it was just suggested to you. Um, I am like the exact opposite of that someone tells me to build a jangle after like that. I don't want to build a jingle app. I want to build a flask app. I want a village static site generator like I want to do everything but the thing that everyone is telling me to do because they're telling me to do it this way. And I need to know why I shouldn't do it that 8000 other ways.</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:03:</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:05:</p>

<p>on top of that, you were actually willing to</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:09:</p>

<p>share that experience with the community and not just the app itself. But I've I've had the privilege of listening to what I would consider the greatest python conference talk ever. Um, which is like, so you want to build a jingle app? It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:25:</p>

<p>you. You bring your personality into</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:30:</p>

<p>all the things that you do like. I'm on the 50 website and it's like how it works. Sometimes life has sad things. We have happy messages,</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:38:</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:25:38:</p>

<p>you're not</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:39:</p>

<p>so sad anymore. And it's just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:42:</p>

<p>it doesn't have this weird like s CEO, like marketing spend using 15 different buzzwords for social ranking and like all of this other stuff that people try to do to game the system. It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:57:</p>

<p>it is</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:58:</p>

<p>truly a Melanie Appetite, Melanie website and time. I would be afraid to look at the code because I'm sure the comments would just have me laughing. It's like, This is stupid. I'm not gonna dio because that's what my code looks like. It's like, I hate that I have to</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:15:</p>

<p>do this</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:16:</p>

<p>But apparently Python hates me. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:20:</p>

<p>usually those air like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:22:</p>

<p>I bet my get history</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:24:</p>

<p>my get history is where I hide my secret feelings for sure. Like less often. Yeah, exactly less often in the code itself, I think.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:35:</p>

<p>But Gathers I think there's some some fun. Makes sense Is that there Are you looking girl, your eyes</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:45:</p>

<p>looking for a good one? Execute some lint ing c L. I love it. It's just like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:50:</p>

<p>Oh, see, that's recent. Yeah, that's me. Just do you want stuff cleaning up?</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, that's I probably should do deleted, weird static directory. Stuff like this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:27:03:</p>

<p>is I go. This is</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:04:</p>

<p>the stuff that I think developers need to see on a more regular basis because you get these weird posts or, like, how to write ineffective, get commit messages like I mean, yes, sure, I understand. If someone's reviewing your code, you want to make it as helpful when is clear and concise as possible, but at the same time being able to just get your frustration out a little bit and I get commit?</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:28:</p>

<p>Sure, do it. I think that's absolutely a wonderful way. Teoh, Uh, one not go insane, but to also again inject a little bit of yourself into your work. And, uh, I mean, you've always done that, But please tell everybody about some of the talks you've given about this about well, about the five up app. And also</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:53:</p>

<p>just why just just why? Because the, um I can't even I can't even begin Teoh like breakdown like the talks themselves because they're so good.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:07:</p>

<p>Ah, they really I mean, that's</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:09:</p>

<p>that's not me. Like, you know, trying to butter you up. I genuinely you made me try Django for the first time, literally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:16:</p>

<p>You're talking</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:17:</p>

<p>like OK, I will use Django, but only because Melanie said it's not as bad as it looks.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:24:</p>

<p>It's not as bad as it looks. Um, yeah, So I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:31:</p>

<p>I think I only have the two talks that I ever</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:35:</p>

<p>like, actually gays. I gave them both multiple times, though, um, And then I did also do a, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:44:</p>

<p>like an injured a python that life on a couple years in a row. Um, that waas, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:51:</p>

<p>in short, a python for human people with feelings.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:55:</p>

<p>Um, which was a lot of fun, I think. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:00:</p>

<p>getting in and out on a 25 minute talk is way more manageable for me. Like I think that that's kind of my sweet spot. Three hours of like, having to make sense is pretty tricky.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:13:</p>

<p>Just like I'm so sorry. Everyone, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:29:16:</p>

<p>three hours long,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:18:</p>

<p>red, like in the end, you're just like, I don't know, let's talk about those bugs again or something. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:27:</p>

<p>so, yeah, the first talk that I wrote waas about my experience writing five up and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:34:</p>

<p>all of the things that I did long because some of them were kind of like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:39:</p>

<p>a little bit tragic, you know, like I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:43:</p>

<p>like, recoverable, like I figured it out. But like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:46:</p>

<p>you know, my email and password were like, committed. And to get at some point</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:52:</p>

<p>like that, I agree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:54:</p>

<p>that it's not the best.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:56:</p>

<p>Um And then just like accidentally destroying stuff, it's all these stuff. I mean, I don't know that everyone, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:30:04:</p>

<p>puts their email and password in their code. Like I feel like I kind of win on that one for, like, dumb stuff that you do on accident. Like I'm pretty</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:15:</p>

<p>sure people have done Aziz Muchas They would admit they'd be like, No, I've never done that. I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:21:</p>

<p>Miguel Road, like McGill did a talk about that. I think it pike on a couple of years ago. That's like you accidentally committed your password. Now what do you dio? And to me, that was great because it was saying like, OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:35:</p>

<p>probably one of the most like prominent people to use the plastic framework is telling me that he has screwed up by putting, you know, some type of environment variable that shouldn't be in there or some type of password or some type of authentic r A p I key. That should not have been hard coded in there like he has done this. So when I mean after that talk, I was like, OK, I am team environment, variable for life like</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:02:</p>

<p>the first thing you see is like import os every time because I'm like I will not do that again. I've had that happen to me where someone's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:11:</p>

<p>Yeah, heads up, You should Ah, like I submitted a PR that removed your password for you and I'm like, Oh, thank you for that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:19:</p>

<p>Cool, Great. That's hopeful.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:23:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. So And I think</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:28:</p>

<p>I don't know. I think it's important for people to know like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:32:</p>

<p>there's there's no magic going on here. I mean, people do harder stuff than what Ideo like. I understand that, um, and that people are hearing like super fans and stuff. Andi. But</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:47:</p>

<p>like I'm fancy enough to be employed. So that's something you know and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:53:</p>

<p>and it's not amazing it I mean, like, it's not. It's not so magical and difficult that you can't do it. You know that you can't like you can become a developer and also be a little bit of a bumbling weirdo like these things can be for you. You could be that in one thing. So like, and I I I feel like our fear of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:19:</p>

<p>wow</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:20:</p>

<p>making mistakes</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:22:</p>

<p>and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:24:</p>

<p>being stealing hard,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:26:</p>

<p>keeps us out of spaces where we could really fries. You know, um, and I always imagine that there's someone in the room that is sitting there being like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:37:</p>

<p>Well, I could never you know, because that's me, like, 48</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:43:</p>

<p>100% of the time I was gonna go 48%. But that's a lie. And 4800. It's not really a value that makes any sense, since, though,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:52:</p>

<p>and I have a job, everybody</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:54:</p>

<p>and and the thing with that, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:59:</p>

<p>I I grew up around</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:01:</p>

<p>like the biggest nerd in the world like my grandfather wanted me to be into computers like he let me take apart his computer. He made me put it back together. Um, like I grew up playing with the max, which is probably why I don't use the Mac's in Al.</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:19:</p>

<p>Like I thought one of the first computer games was Eclipse, which is ah, like a job I d</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:28:</p>

<p>on. He was</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:29:</p>

<p>just like, yeah, I just draw stuff in the things and I was like, OK, cool. I'm gonna make a computer game and, like No, no, I didn't. But he knew that I wasn't going to, but he was like Yeah, sure. Try it anyway. And like, this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:40:</p>

<p>is the kind of</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:41:</p>

<p>guy that he went to the university library to doubt, like rent out algebra books for fun. And I'm just like your old man. You're supposed to be, like, watching like, daytime news and sleeping on the couch or something. And I always thought that that's what it meant to be like in the tech space of lying. So you gotta get a like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:06:</p>

<p>if you haven't read every Manning book that's out there, you have it. If you don't have, like, the subscription toe like O'Reilly learning, then you're doing it wrong. You need toe. You need to, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:17:</p>

<p>have submitted, like at least three talks toe every major conference using your language. You need to have been to every talk. Like I hear about all the people that love and fawn over WWDC, and they're like, Oh, it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:33:</p>

<p>the mecca for IOS developers is like, Oh, it's like the mecca for conference viruses. So you probably shouldn't like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:42:</p>

<p>put that stigma on people. Not everyone wants to go to a conference. Everyone is can understand half of what you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:52:</p>

<p>someone who has a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering and has turned that into, like writing functional algorithms using Haskell like not everyone can do.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:05:</p>

<p>Not everyone can understand that. And if</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:07:</p>

<p>you don't, it's okay. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:09:</p>

<p>I think</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:10:</p>

<p>Python, because it's readable, literally showed</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:13:</p>

<p>100 lines of python code that I had written Teoh, a graphic designer, and they were like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:19:</p>

<p>I think you miss. I think there's a space after this comma that's not supposed to be there. And I was like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:24:</p>

<p>How are you debugging my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:29:</p>

<p>like that to</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:30:</p>

<p>me is amazing that people can look at the code, read it and understand what's happening, and that it eliminates the stigma of like you have to have void and no parameters instead of code and and it immediately closes the door on people who are just like, Yeah, I just wanna send five happy tweets. You know, our five happy text to my phone like, Can I do that?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:53:</p>

<p>No. One?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:55:</p>

<p>No, I I love Python. For that reason, I do think like it's one of the more low entry languages out there.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:05:</p>

<p>I've been working with Java script a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and I want to love all languages equally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:19:</p>

<p>I want that so bad.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:21:</p>

<p>Also Pythons the best. I don't know. I don't. I'm sorry, everyone. I just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:28:</p>

<p>It's just clean ends.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:32:</p>

<p>I don't know. It's it's low entry. I think, Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:37:</p>

<p>yeah, it's good stuff, but what you were saying, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:42:</p>

<p>a second ago about</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:44:</p>

<p>this huge range of like one</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:48:</p>

<p>you know, one engineer has a PhD in is doing this grace and stuff, you know, down to like, here's me,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:56:</p>

<p>you know, making my little Web app. That doesn't silly and nice thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:01:</p>

<p>Um, that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:03:</p>

<p>that gap</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:06:</p>

<p>was really difficult and overwhelming to experience at my first pie con, Um, because it's, you know what, like 3500 people or something. And you do have these people that have their doctorates and, you know, like listening to some of the talks. I remember because I was, you know, obviously much newer to Python at the time. Um, but I remember just being like I'm not doing,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:35:</p>

<p>you know, like we'd go into a room and there's like, Here's a 20 minute talk</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:40:</p>

<p>and, like I know they said words and there were slides like there were visuals, so a lot of stuff happening there. And yet</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:48:</p>

<p>I have no idea what just happened.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:52:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:54:</p>

<p>no, you know, And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:57:</p>

<p>the,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:58:</p>

<p>you know, kind of the little circles of people that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:02:</p>

<p>then joined up in our like, you know, what do you dio And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:06:</p>

<p>you know, like, I do fancy things, You know? I'm like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:11:</p>

<p>Hyson tweets the tell you your sparkling mermaid, not tweets and text messages, You know, actual message by the way you mentioned earlier. Bob Ross. Do you know that? I quote Bob Breast in private.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:24:</p>

<p>I didn't. And now</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:27:</p>

<p>I I don't get text messages. City</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I probably drug simple.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:32:</p>

<p>No, it's not you. It's I go, Yeah, I did this thing where it was like, don't ever get a message or like, a phone call from anyone that's on your favorites. And ever since then, people like chaos and your message lychee After you did</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:49:</p>

<p>e don't get half my messages anymore, which is great, cause I have plausible deniability. Anytime I don't want to do something like I didn't get the message. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's awesome.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:59:</p>

<p>I mean, you broke up with me, and I just found out</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:03:</p>

<p>and we literally had a like It's not years me moments that happened</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:10:</p>

<p>that's gonna be on the Internet now is fine. Oh, man.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:14:</p>

<p>Science. My received text that I send myself. That's what I going to dio like self wish that I do. Now</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:23:</p>

<p>I'm gonna do the horrible thing you should never do after a breakup. I'm just gonna keep going forward.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:28:</p>

<p>Thank</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:32:</p>

<p>you. Talked about, like, just kind of the vast difference of conversations that air had it conferences.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:42:</p>

<p>I gave my first conference talk at North Bay Python last year and, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:50:</p>

<p>I couldn't go. So a conference, it</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:53:</p>

<p>really isn't there not having won this year, which I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:57:</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:58:</p>

<p>they announced it last year that they were having won. I felt like I felt like they</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:02:</p>

<p>feel like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:02:</p>

<p>Josh knew he was just like, something's gonna happen. He's like, we don't want to be a part of it. We're out this year will see on two years. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:12:</p>

<p>one of the talks, that was it was like the second I was the last talk in the first half. And then the next talk after me was Greedo. And he was talking about writing. He was</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:25:</p>

<p>talking about writing</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:25:</p>

<p>a peg par surfer python. And I'm just like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:29:</p>

<p>I don't know what</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:30:</p>

<p>you're talking about. I'm gonna look, and I'm just gonna be like, Okay, Yeah, sure, whatever. And then we all got dinner together and it was me,</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:41:</p>

<p>you know, And then, like a couple of other developers that are like python core maintainers and I'm just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:48:</p>

<p>and luckily, my talk was mostly about podcasting, So I felt like I knew what I was talking about, but they were all like, Ah, yes. So I would really love to learn how like podcasting could be implemented, you know, in a larger</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:04:</p>

<p>audience in the python community. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I would love to learn more about whatever it is you talked about earlier to Andi. That's like, That's the crazy feeling that when we create this facade that, like, you have to have a PhD, you have to be, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:23:</p>

<p>a huge brainiac to write code that matters. What you're doing is you're taking your skill set away from the people that could genuinely benefit from the things that you can bring to the table like has a podcaster I know way more than any human should about dealing with transcriptions with AWS and</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:47:</p>

<p>having these talks with mentors where it's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:51:</p>

<p>Hey, I built a framework that does like it creates a</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:55:</p>

<p>standard schema for transcription. So matter what Web service you're using, whatever developable law. And they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:02:</p>

<p>why? I was like because you told me I needed a project that would make me hire Well, that's why. And they're like But why that when I was like, Well, it's because it's a thing that I have to deal with on a regular basis. So and as we're breaking it down and like talking about it, they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:18:</p>

<p>Wait,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:20:</p>

<p>what you built this I'm like, Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but like, you know, this is like, this is stuff that you would give, like a keynote talk on, like the whole process of building this stuff. And it's like I just had a problem that I need to solve. So I solved it. And then I realized that there was a bigger problem, so I started working on solving that, too, and they're like, Yeah, that's what developers do. Congratulations and I'm like, Well, okay, I still need a job</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:50:</p>

<p>like no one's gonna take me serious If I'm just the guy that comes up and goes, Hey, I do podcasting. Come on, let's talk about Python. Um, it and that's where it's It's so frustrating because it's like, How do we fix that? And I've literally had people telling me like</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:06:</p>

<p>you would give really good talks it, like the local conference seen and I'm like, What the hell does that mean? And they're like, Well, you know, some talks were made for conferences that have less than, like 1000 people and then some. Some talks were made for people that are not for people, but for conferences that have, like there, like Pike on Level. And I'm like, Okay, that's stupid. Like I feel like my should be good</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:30:</p>

<p>one of</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:30:</p>

<p>the people</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:33:</p>

<p>that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:35:</p>

<p>that's frustrating. That's a frustrating thing that you just described that someone said, like also, I'm gonna go and say That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:46:</p>

<p>so. And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:50:</p>

<p>because a at Piper on not every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:55:</p>

<p>talk is Aquino.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:58:</p>

<p>Just just in case anyone hasn't been before, there's either. There's a handful of key notes, but when you pulled off. All the majority of the stocks are in a small room, you know. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:11:</p>

<p>talk it, Pike. On talking a local conference like you could end up with the same number of people like ends. You know, Northway Python. It's single track. So instead of you know, at high Con, where you have seven different walks, you could go to it and given time slot,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:27:</p>

<p>you know, Northway Python. There's one you're gonna end up with it a pack grim.</p>

<p>Jay 00:44:32:</p>

<p>Everybody at that conference paid to hear you talk.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. It's wonderful. So there's that element. But also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:43:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:44:</p>

<p>I feel like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:49:</p>

<p>you never know why</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:51:</p>

<p>your talk gets turned away from any particular conference. You know, it could be that they got</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:58:</p>

<p>a bunch of different talks on that same topic. Like it just so happens to be that way, you know? I mean, unless is it are you doing close like sleight of hand magic? Is that because I can see I can say that being like meeting a small room</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:15:</p>

<p>for this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:15:</p>

<p>presentation, a volunteer</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:19:</p>

<p>and need a volunteer, and everyone has to be within arm's length of my body</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:24:</p>

<p>so and I don't know. I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:29:</p>

<p>I think in general, in life,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:32:</p>

<p>none of us know we're doing like, ever. So when people sit down and they're like, Well, this thing is good for this circumstance, Like, you know, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:43:</p>

<p>none of us know what we're doing. Just admit it and go on, like with any of the stuff we're doing. We're lucky that we still exist as a species.</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:57:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And I want in this on a way more positive. Note that wherever you are now, So please tell me what's what's next for five up. Is there anything next for five up? Is it just gonna be more of the same? And I'm okay with that, too, cause I'm happy with it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:15:</p>

<p>Um well, first is fixing the very important broken thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:22:</p>

<p>This so that that's sexy updates coming at you fast. Um, but there are There are some things that I've wanted to dio um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:32:</p>

<p>So there's a database that I curate of messages that go out, but you've been also every user has a personal needs, so I can send you my link, and you can put a nice message into my cue and I'll get that mixed in with the other curated ones. Um, and that's like actually a really, really fun and powerful</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:52:</p>

<p>um, feature. What I want to do with that is make it so that you can see your past messages like your past custom ones and break you them, because right now you get it once and you never see it again. So I don't want to reveal them before you get thm. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:12:</p>

<p>because the surprise is important.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:14:</p>

<p>We like surprised, like delight is in surprise. Unless it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:20:</p>

<p>surprise your bankrupt like That's not awesome. But like surprise. I think you're a cool person. Is like is nice, you know, So I don't want to reveal them before you see them, But it's</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:31:</p>

<p>some of the custom messages that I've received, and I know that other people have received have been really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:41:</p>

<p>like they can hold you up, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:44:</p>

<p>um and so if you have the option to go back and say, like, actually, just keep that in my queue all the time, you know some that's me, every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:51:</p>

<p>Howard along. That's that's one thing that I've been wanting to dio, um, I want to make it some people can suggest</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:59:</p>

<p>things for the general database. And then I can</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:02:</p>

<p>say that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:03:</p>

<p>you know, I can allow them to go in because the it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:08:</p>

<p>350 messages or so that are in there. But they're all ones that I've stood in. You know that I signed and thinker interesting have been there but would be nice to have other people. You know, we have a lot of men, but then it's You do have lots and Jay Peak America's like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:24:</p>

<p>Yeah, some people have weird,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:27:</p>

<p>weird heroes out there. This is So, um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:32:</p>

<p>you think those air</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:35:</p>

<p>I I have been wanting to, like, make it a tweet pot or so, but that's like latter. Now I would love to be able to send pictures. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:45:</p>

<p>but that's kind of it's all kind of tricky because it's this weird like, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:51:</p>

<p>sent through like it sent by email to the SMTP gateway for each of the carriers, you know, for a long period. So there's a little bit of tricking us involved there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:04:</p>

<p>You mentioned using Tulio earlier, and we're definitely not gonna get too deep into the weeds here, But the</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:12:</p>

<p>Tulio a p I has that like SMS thing?</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:18:</p>

<p>Is that utilizing the same like email stuff? Or is that actually using, like a phone number type</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:25:</p>

<p>whatever.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:29:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:30:</p>

<p>abandoned twilio straightaway because it's very expensive. Um, especially if you get any number of users that are getting five messages a day legs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:43:</p>

<p>I can't afford that is quite expensive. And so but send bread,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:48:</p>

<p>um, was very affordable. And so I had to kind of do this hack around to figure out how to use the S and P gateways to send The message is so like each carrier has like, a phone number at</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:01:</p>

<p>something at 18 c commune over something like this. So you email the</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:07:</p>

<p>that email address, then it comes through a text.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:11:</p>

<p>So that's what I did. And then, interestingly enough, uh, Tulio then acquired sin bread and ensure</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:19:</p>

<p>they have not jacked up saying grits, Princes, is this I know. Or maybe I've like, you know, I just got in at the right time, But, um, when I saw that, I was like, Please don't touch me more money. I do this for fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:33:</p>

<p>I want people to be happy. But like, not like many, many hundreds of dollars are happy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:39:</p>

<p>All of my users air happy. I am miserable because I got a 48th of happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:44:</p>

<p>Yeah, I can do that. I can't do that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:47:</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:49:</p>

<p>yeah, that's how that works.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:50:</p>

<p>And five up is free, right?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>One of his act. Yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:57:</p>

<p>Uh, though message and data rates may apply. I just saw that at the bottom.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:02:</p>

<p>Yeah, I did that stuff that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:06:</p>

<p>doesn't say like expensive messages are not happy. I'm pretty sure I shove blood in there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:11:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:12:</p>

<p>Lissy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:13:</p>

<p>Yes? Make sure you know about your texting and data plan. Expensive messages are not happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:19:</p>

<p>They're not. I mean, I have a good database of messages, but, like, I don't know if they cost you 1/4. No, e, I don't know. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:29:</p>

<p>Oh, man, that's too good. All right, well, let's let's get ready to button this up, cause we seven after show to get Teoh. Um, let everybody know once again, if they want to talk to you or if they want to learn more about five up, um, Or if they wanna check out any of your amazing conference talks, where can they do all of those things.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:52:</p>

<p>Let's see. So five up is five a pap dot com.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:58:</p>

<p>Um, I am on Twitter and, like, everywhere on the Internet almost is. Hello, Melanie C. Um, so twitters where I hang out the most, um, Facebook and I are on a break.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:11:</p>

<p>Eso don't look for me there. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:15:</p>

<p>see what else?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:18:</p>

<p>Five apps on Twitter. I think it's high by Bob the terrible</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:22:</p>

<p>project, Mom,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:24:</p>

<p>it's on there somewhere. You'll find it just 11.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:27:</p>

<p>Some branding thing will figure that out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, and then all of my talk, sir, on YouTube. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:35:</p>

<p>if you want, you can keep them all up and compare each, you know, performance to the next and rate them and send it to me. And I'll get real sad about it. Never beautiful.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:47:</p>

<p>I would recommend the ah, the North Bay Python talk.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:51:</p>

<p>Um, about how to get started. To Jingo, it was very, very funny. I heard multiple people, not just me say that it was the best talk of the entire conference, so Oh, yeah. You could definitely got that award.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:08:</p>

<p>yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:09:</p>

<p>it was It was a fun one. It was fun. Everything went wrong. Little preview furry you people out there the panic that you see Israel. It was not staged.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:19:</p>

<p>Oh, I remember that. It was Yeah, that was</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:24:</p>

<p>I think I triple prepared for my talk. Because of that, I was just like, I know it works. I know everything is good. I'm just going to do it again just to make sure. And also that was their first year doing a conference. So I'm sure, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:40:</p>

<p>the first year versus the third year, though, should they got a lot of bugs? You know, it</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:45:</p>

<p>wasn't them. It wasn't them. It was me. And I swear to you, I had practiced that talk so many times. And the things that went wrong that you saw had never gone wrong before. Like had not gone run 30 minutes prior. When that happens, been in the green room. It was just, you know, the stars just aligns to really make me vulnerable and sweaty, very sweaty.</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:10:</p>

<p>All right, well, thank you so much for being my esteemed guests on the show</p>

<p>Melanie 00:54:16:</p>

<p>on. And well, now</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:18:</p>

<p>I love this because I know that in a post Corentin like</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:25:</p>

<p>huge world on fire kind of thing that we're living in right now.</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:30:</p>

<p>Eventually, we will be able to sit down and</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:34:</p>

<p>have dinner and talk and laugh and do all the things that we did on the show s So I can say for one that this this isn't This isn't a bit. This isn't anything. This is This is 100% Melanie. Every time I have talked to her like I I absolutely love and enjoy our conversations. Um, no, you are also the first person to tell Meteo give a talk, so Oh, yeah, I have to thank you for that</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:04:</p>

<p>s o. Thank you so much for being on the show. And</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:09:</p>

<p>now, time for all the stuff that quote unquote pays the bills. Uh, thank you for listening. Everyone out there. I do something different that most podcasters don't. I don't ask you for money. I just ask that as you were listening to this, you weren't like doing 15 other things that you actually listen to. The things that my guest and I were talking about because</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:33:</p>

<p>we get vulnerable. We talk about our experiences when we talk about the things that matter to us and we do it in a way that We hope that it can resonate with other people out there. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:44:</p>

<p>I don't ask that you raider review the show. I ask that you just listen.</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:47:</p>

<p>But if you feel like you must</p>

<p>tell me about something that I said that was obviously wrong or stupid, you can do so on Twitter at KJ. Why, Miller? I will ignore it. I will block you. Um, but if it was nice, I'll reply back and say Thanks. Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:56:03:</p>

<p>yeah. If you are a podcast or thinking about getting into podcasting, you need some help with that. You can reach out to me at info at productivity in tech dot com.</p>

<p>Jay 00:56:12:</p>

<p>And of course, thank you to my uncle. Most people don't realize that when I say that but my uncle in a diorama wallet for the use of his music, a hustler in spite of myself for the Intron Ultra music, I'm only doing this because melodious, smiling at me, and it's like, Well, she did say you have to know people, so I know people. That's how I got my break. So there we go.</p>

<title>Can we fix this?</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been mostly silent in this time, mostly as I needed time to think
about what I would like to see come out of all this.</p>

<h2>How to Fix Racism</h2>

<p>Racism is all over the world. Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.</p>

<p>I don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and
become equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.
Instead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust
punishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never
able to gain any amount of legitimate growth.</p>

<p>Force the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that
are disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest
person of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the
only one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.</p>

<p>If you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely
(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for
you.</p>

<h2>On Rioting</h2>

<p>In my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.
Furthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me
from my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked
to be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and
the fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint
and had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took
them from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the
age of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop
car over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,
uneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you
have pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local
communities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation
of Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict
government oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.</p>

<p>It took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is
founded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we
murdered until we got it.</p>

<p>We did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to
ourselves (see civil war).</p>

<p>Now when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our
nation call us Terrorists.</p>

<p>While I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and
maintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying
the example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those
that murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while
the rest of society looked away.</p>

<h2>On The Legal System</h2>

<p>In regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who
have the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout
my wishes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down</li>
<li>More racial and gender diversity in police forces</li>
<li>Mandatory implicit bias checks and training</li>
<li>Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making
an arrest.</li>
<li>The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws</li>
</ul>

<p>These ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how
they can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that
can't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up
for themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly. And be willing to listen when we do speak up.</p>

<title>May 2020 - Monthly Catchup</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is also available via my <a href="https://buttondown.email/productivityintech">Newsletter</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Monthly Catchup</h1>

<p>Speaking of Ketchup, here are some <a href="https://sharedappetite.com/recipes/10-creative-artisan-ketchup-flavors/">Artisan Ketchup Ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>Productivity in Tech Podcast</h2>

<p>This month on the [PIT Podcast] I interviewed my good internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl">Christina Morrillo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/pit-v3.jpg" alt="pit podcast" /></a></p>

<h2>The Biz</h2>

<p>Business has been good. I'll be talking about this in my [premium newsletter] where I break down how I run my business, the workflows the code, the everything (but the clients). </p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>"<em>In these Troubled Times</em>" 🤮</p>

<p>Just Kidding. Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. </p>

<p>I've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.</p>

<p>This Month, I purchased <a href="https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a>. I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other <a href="https://devontechnologies.com">DevonTechnologies</a> Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Render Engine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my [personal blog]</li>
<li>Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.</li>
<li>Support for Categories and Tags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcriptor</h3>

<p>I launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. </p>

<h3>Episde-DL</h3>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/">Episode-DL</a> is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.</p>

<h3>Following Me</h3>

<p>You can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>If you have an RSS Reader that you use. Consider Subscribing to my [Blog] or [Microblog].</p>

<title>Friends have been my Greatest Asset!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been letting folks know about my <a href="https://productivityintech.com/coaching">coaching</a> and <a href="https://productivityintech.com/editing">editing</a> services more and more these days. </p>

<p>It's been a slow progressing growth. This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. </p>

<h2>Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.</h2>

<p>I've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. </p>

<p>100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis <strong>or</strong> they were recommended by the aforementioned person.</p>

<p>While I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.</p>

<p>I know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. </p>

<h2>Ways to do this</h2>

<h3>1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.</h3>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg" alt="" />
<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small></p>

<p>One of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. </p>

<p>Each of them have their own reach and their own network. 
I've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. </p>

<p>I've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. </p>

<h3>2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method</h3>

<p>Some relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the <a href="https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/">Noguchi Filing Method</a>. </p>

<p>The Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. 
<img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. </p>

<h3>3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)</h3>

<p>I got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)</p>
  
  <p>Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and "unicorn" services.</p>
  
  <p>I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. </p>
  
  <p>Here is a list of the services I provide.</p>
  
  <p>My skills include:
  - social media
  - recording videos and screencasts
  - podcast editing and recording
  - community management
  - newsletter publishing</p>
  
  <p>Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?</p>
  
  <p>Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. </p>

<p>I didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.</p>

<p>One person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.</p>

<p>The other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. </p>

<p>================</p>

<p>None of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this <em>grimy</em> feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your "inner-circle" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.</p>

<title>How I AutoUpdate My Github README using GitHub Actions in 5 Easy Steps</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>A new phenominon in the developer space is now the 🌟<em>secret</em>🌟 README.md
trick. If you have a repository with the EXACT (case-sensitive) name as your username, it will display the contents of that readme onto your GitHub profile.</p>

<p>Some folks have done really cool things with it, including setting up your own
Myspace-esque top8 (including Tom!).</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check it out. I made MySpace but on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>.<a href="https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR">https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR</a> - My list is power by a GitHub Action workflow 😏 <a href="https://t.co/PN80mFCqOE">pic.twitter.com/PN80mFCqOE</a></p>&mdash; Brian Douglas (@bdougieYO) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieYO/status/1281699715466199040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">Simon Willison's</a> amazing self-updating profile, I wanted to do something similar.</p>

<p>Armed with the power of python (<em>and anime on my side</em>), I setout to do something similar. This is a look at the first steps of me automating my Github Profile.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Rename the repo my website to a repo named after my GitHub username</h3>

<p>This is easy enough. Just rename the repo (in Github) to your username.
Remember this has to be exact and it is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>You can do this in the settings menu of your repo. You don't have to change the
directory names or anything like that on a local machine. (I'm not sure if you
are using a Git Client other than the cli).</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a copy of your existing readme as a template</h3>

<p>My goal was to create my README using a Jinja2 and Github Actions. For that I
would need a template to render. So since most of the data was the same I just
copied my existing README.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Dynamic Content using Jinja2 Variables</h3>

<p>Starting out I wanted to show my latest blog post and my latest podcast episode
from <a href="https://podcast.productivityiintech.com">Productivity in Tech Podcast</a>. We will create a python script that does
this, but we needed to add the variables that Jinja2 would use for the dynamic
data.</p>

<p>You could do something like a search and replace, but I feel like just
rendering a template is much easier to edit and understand. Also, the compute
time for Github Actions is free and this doesn't need to be the most
performance conscious program. Also I like Jinja2, so there is also that 🙃.</p>

<pre><code># From README_template.md

**Latest Productivity in Tech Podcast Episode - [{{latest_podcast_post.title}}]({{latest_podcast_post.link}})**

## Active Projects
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 4: Build your script to get the data and write the up to date README.md</h3>

<p>This script is pretty simple once you know what you're looking for. I'm using
the feedparser plugin to parse the rss feeds and then returning the title and
link for the latest episode.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">feedparser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">latest_post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sorted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;entries&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;published_parsed&#39;</span><span class="p">])[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;link&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;link&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then you set the template to the text of your template file.
 then write the rendered text to your README.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># update readme</span>
<span class="n">template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./README_template.md&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_text</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./README.md&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write_text</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">template</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">),</span>
            <span class="n">latest_podcast_post</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">podcast_url</span><span class="p">),</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Step 5: Setup your Github Actions File</h2>

<p>I'm not the best at Github Actions. Luckily for me, this action was super
simple to setup. </p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/kjaymiller/blob/master/.github/workflows/latest_post_readme.yml">.yml file</a> I'm not going to talk about the setup of this
because most of it is prep stuff. Here's the important bit.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># in steps:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Install Feedparser &amp; Jinja2</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pip install feedparser jinja2</span>

<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Update Readme</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">python ./.github/actions/update_readme.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Basically it's installing the things I need and then running the script (I
saved the script in that folder, but you don't really have to as long as its in
your repo).</p>

<p>After that, you add some commands to update your repo and you're off to the
races.</p>

<p>I have mine setup to update on a github push in that repo, but in the future I
will probably setup the file on a schedule to also update when I push something
new (Future Post...Probably).</p>

<title>How Can White People Help Black People. What is the Real Problem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from a personal conversation I had.</p>

<p>Not to be the Subject matter black guy or anything but a couple of years of research and several years of living has taught me this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.</li>
<li>There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.</li>
<li>We can't blame "fathers not being in the homes". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.</li>
<li>White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>My thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these "Dangerous" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years</p>

<h3>How Do You Fix Number 2?</h3>

<p>Make education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.</p>

<p>As someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.</p>

<p>My chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.</p>

<p>I will put it clearly...</p>

<p><strong>HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.</strong></p>

<p>It won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>We can't pull ourselves up by our bootstraps if we can't afford boots.</em>" - Someone that at one point couldn't afford boots.</p>

<title>My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been on a tear with new podcasts, live streams, and communities.</p>

<p>My secret is these are all <em>cries for help</em>. </p>

<p>Not in a life threatening way, but in the stuck in an axiety induced feedback loop. </p>

<p><img src="https://questionablecontent.net/comics/3953.png" alt="Questionable Content Comic by Jeph Jacques" /></p>

<p>I've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more <em>fatalistic</em> and irrational towards things not going according to plan. </p>

<h3>Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?</h3>

<p><em>HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW</em></p>

<p>It just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. </p>

<p>I will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.</p>

<h3>Why are you telling us this?</h3>

<p>I'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. </p>

<p>It took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>

<p>I understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. </p>

<h2>Transcription</h2>

<p>00:00:18:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>Jay Miller here back with a solo PIT Reflection type thing for the first half of June 2020. this year has sucked royally.</p>

<p>00:00:32:</p>

<p>I don't even want to get into this. Um, all of the individual things that have happened in 2020 have just been nightmarish at best.</p>

<p>00:00:46:</p>

<p>So this is going to be more of a productivity's side thought exercise for me, and I hope that it will engage your mind a little bit as we sit down and talk.</p>

<p>That said, it is gonna be a little bit off the head. I have some notes and I'll use those notes. But ultimately, I'm just using them to riff off of.</p>

<p>00:01:13:</p>

<p>So let's start with a couple of things. First of all, productivity's in general. What am I doing, Productivity wise?</p>

<p>Um, if you would have asked me this question yesterday, I would have told you something different. I am jumping back to the notebook. I go to the notebook like probably once a year. I'm gonna try to do a full year.</p>

<p>00:01:38:</p>

<p>Don't at me. Don't challenge me. Don't do any of those things the way that I see it productivity tools, productivity, apps, productivity. All of those things should be used for you to do your best work. None of these tools should be considered a Bible or any type of gospel for you to breach or proselytize on others.</p>

<p>00:02:06:</p>

<p>In fact, I'm not using this podcast to preach or proselytize my own productivity method. I am merely telling people how I am doing a thing in hopes that if someone else that is doing something similar here, is it that I might be able to inspire them to try something that works for them or for them to reach out to me and let me know of something that did work for them without any obligation to join the Church of Notion or Rome research or obsidian or all these other apps that said, Let's jump into this.</p>

<p>00:02:51:</p>

<p>What absolute using. Like I said, up until today, when I said, You know what, we need to get back on our analog light, our BuJo-esque system.</p>

<p>00:03:03:</p>

<p>I would have said I was using OmniFocus. Um, I think for right now I I don't really have too much stuff in OmniFocus. That will make it hard to transition.</p>

<p>00:03:19:</p>

<p>I wasn't really using OmniFocus as the power tool that most people use it as, um, it was simply a way for me to differ things so that I didn't have to look at him.</p>

<p>Good thing is a notebook and a piece of paper kind of does the same thing. I just don't need to look at it now.</p>

<p>00:03:39:</p>

<p>One of the biggest apps that I have jumped on. Probably the biggest change in my workflow since leaving Evernote back in 2000 and what, 10? Yeah, I think 2010 was when I left Evernote or not.</p>

<p>00:03:57:</p>

<p>Didn't leave it like the company I stopped using.</p>

<p>00:03:59:</p>

<p>The application is the adoption of DEVONthink now, DEVONthink, is one of these tools that I think that a lot of people are intimidated by one.</p>

<p>00:04:13:</p>

<p>It's an expensive tool.</p>

<p>00:04:15:</p>

<p>I get that. Yeah, it's expensive.</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>Oh, boy, A suspensive.</p>

<p>It's like fountain pen money expensive.</p>

<p>00:04:23:</p>

<p>The thing I like about DEVONthink is I don't have to question where I put a thing.</p>

<p>00:04:31:</p>

<p>I deal with a lot of files between the day job, the side business and the other ambitions and inspirations that I have.</p>

<p>00:04:42:</p>

<p>So for me, it is important that when I'm looking for a thing, I can find it with relative ease.</p>

<p>00:04:51:</p>

<p>DEVONthink allows me to do that.</p>

<p>00:04:54:</p>

<p>It does its job really well.</p>

<p>00:04:58:</p>

<p>And the thing that makes it different from, you know, another power tool that I use Drafts or Evernote or again, like a Notion or Rome Research kind of tool is that one.</p>

<p>00:05:15:</p>

<p>It beats all the cloud tools because it's designed to work with my local machine.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>So adding some order to my chaotic system.</p>

<p>00:05:26:</p>

<p>The other thing that it does is it make some connections and allows me to easily connect things that should be connected.</p>

<p>00:05:39:</p>

<p>And it allows me to look at different things from many different schools of thought, which isn't always the best way to do things.</p>

<p>00:05:54:</p>

<p>But when you need to, it is amazing.</p>

<p>00:06:01:</p>

<p>So again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this.</p>

<p>00:06:03:</p>

<p>If you've been looking at DEVONthink you'd know all the stuff that I could talk about with it?</p>

<p>00:06:09:</p>

<p>Um, if you aren't looking into DEVONthink unless you just genuinely have a problem with maintaining lots and lots of files and documents and things like that over a long period of time.</p>

<p>00:06:22:</p>

<p>Or you're just fed up with Evernote as a whole and its inability to, um, not move like a giant green elephant in a china shop, you know, then I mean, give it a try.</p>

<p>00:06:37:</p>

<p>There's a free trial.</p>

<p>00:06:38:</p>

<p>Give it a shot.</p>

<p>00:06:39:</p>

<p>I mean, if you really want to talk about it, they have a forum.</p>

<p>00:06:42:</p>

<p>They have, um a lot of people that air again, much more avid users shout out to the Nested Folders podcast.</p>

<p>00:06:50:</p>

<p>They did a great to show seriess on how they both use. DEVONthink in their own systems.</p>

<p>00:06:59:</p>

<p>One, uh, uses it more of, ah, file cabinet, the other one more of ah ah, thought companion.</p>

<p>00:07:10:</p>

<p>But there's an app that I wanted to talk about a little bit from the business side, and this is after I haven't used a hun.</p>

<p>00:07:23:</p>

<p>But I've used it.</p>

<p>00:07:25:</p>

<p>And when I have used it, it has had a really good effect.</p>

<p>00:07:30:</p>

<p>Uh, I used to do business meetings any type of any time I was doing, like a client consultation.</p>

<p>00:07:36:</p>

<p>I would use something like notion.</p>

<p>00:07:39:</p>

<p>Um, I'm a firm believer in the idea of shared notes are better when you're able to collaborate on them.</p>

<p>00:07:50:</p>

<p>The one problem that I had with notion initially was that you know, you get us up in account, you got to give them access, they can watch, you do stuff, and that's cool.</p>

<p>00:07:59:</p>

<p>But ultimately, it doesn't feel as inviting for someone that's not a part of your team to come in and start working with you.</p>

<p>00:08:07:</p>

<p>And there was also, like the pricing question and things like that.</p>

<p>00:08:10:</p>

<p>But for the last couple of consultations that I've had, I have used a tool called Miro. MIRO is an interesting little tool.</p>

<p>00:08:22:</p>

<p>It is basically a collaborative white board, and it's designed to be a collaborative white board. One of the things I like about is that it also gives you a section for your notes. It allows you to attach things. It allows you to collect a bunch of stuff under one umbrella.</p>

<p>00:08:38:</p>

<p>I mean, imagine having a giant whiteboard and being able to just have everybody writing on it and asking questions and commenting and doing things like that.</p>

<p>00:08:49:</p>

<p>I really like it, Um, especially for like a consultation type thing.</p>

<p>00:08:57:</p>

<p>I haven't used it at the premium level where they have stuff like of voice and video chat and stuff like that.</p>

<p>00:09:06:</p>

<p>I mean, just you zoom.</p>

<p>00:09:08:</p>

<p>Or I think in my last consultation call, I like, I think we just use facetime and then, as we were talking, you know, we're both adding stuff into it so that's cool by itself.</p>

<p>00:09:21:</p>

<p>But yeah, I mean, again, just this isn't an attempt to get people to try stuff.</p>

<p>00:09:27:</p>

<p>It's more of Ah, hey, here's something that if you haven't heard about it and it's something that it suits you, then sure, why not take a crack at it?</p>

<p>00:09:34:</p>

<p>It's not gonna be life changing for someone unless it is the exact thing that they're looking for.</p>

<p>00:09:42:</p>

<p>So we've talked a little bit about the productivity side of things.</p>

<p>00:09:47:</p>

<p>Let's jump into the projects.</p>

<p>00:09:51:</p>

<p>Ah, but to do nothings really changed much on the project side of life.</p>

<p>00:09:55:</p>

<p>I mean, it is it's still basically render engine and transcript.</p>

<p>00:09:59:</p>

<p>Or for me, I do believe the last time we had a conversation like this transcriptor was still just a Django app now it is no longer Django app.</p>

<p>00:10:09:</p>

<p>It is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor/">python package</a>.</p>

<p>00:10:13:</p>

<p>Yes, but he s the best way to put it.</p>

<p>00:10:16:</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I realized that I don't want to build a SaaS app.</p>

<p>00:10:21:</p>

<p>I know that there are a bunch of people out there.</p>

<p>00:10:23:</p>

<p>They're like, "Oh, yeah, SaaS applications!"</p>

<p>00:10:25:</p>

<p>"That's passive income and smart revenue."</p>

<p>00:10:28:</p>

<p>And there's a whole conversation to have about that.</p>

<p>00:10:31:</p>

<p>But that is not me.</p>

<p>00:10:33:</p>

<p>What I enjoy doing more than anything is helping people directly by me providing a service to them.</p>

<p>00:10:41:</p>

<p>Now I know that's not scalable.</p>

<p>00:10:43:</p>

<p>I understand that.</p>

<p>00:10:45:</p>

<p>I don't care.</p>

<p>00:10:46:</p>

<p>Um, there's a excellent book that I've been reading on and off, you know, for the last who knows how long.</p>

<p>00:10:52:</p>

<p>Called <em>Company of One</em>_ by Paul Jarvis.</p>

<p>00:10:55:</p>

<p>I think that there is an amazing idea and an amazing benefit to imposing a limit of scalability on yourself and on your company.</p>

<p>00:11:09:</p>

<p>And here's Here's what I mean, if I use pit transcriptor, as you know, we'll pick transcript of the Django app.</p>

<p>00:11:17:</p>

<p>It's a great tool that allows anybody to sign up for an account and start doing transcriptions and Ultimately, I'm eating the cost, which means I'm having to charge people memberships, which means I am now in the business of customer service.</p>

<p>00:11:31:</p>

<p>I'm in the business of tech support, and I am in the business of having to explain to people why Amazon transcribe does some of the things that it does because of how it does it.</p>

<p>00:11:44:</p>

<p>And there are a lot of different things that Amazon transcribe Google Cloud Platform or Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>00:11:54:</p>

<p>All of these services do certain things because they have to in order to scale at the level that they want to scale.</p>

<p>00:12:03:</p>

<p>But what's the alternative here?</p>

<p>00:12:07:</p>

<p>I could build a system that allows me personally to do transcriptions at a rate that I can afford in that I could maintain and by providing it as a python package.</p>

<p>00:12:22:</p>

<p>There is a level of support that I'm willing to give, but a lot of that is I can now define the scope of the application of the package that I'm supporting.</p>

<p>00:12:37:</p>

<p>If I decide that the transcript or packages on Lee going to support AWS Transcribe, then okay, I have the ability to do that if I decide that transcriptor is not going to support custom vocabulary.</p>

<p>00:13:03:</p>

<p>I can do that if I and these are all things that I have chosen to do.</p>

<p>00:13:13:</p>

<p>If I decide that transcript is only going to focus on the resulted output of a transcription job and not the actual processing of the job itself, I conduce that.</p>

<p>00:13:29:</p>

<p>And by doing that, I narrow the scope that I am responsible for to my clients.</p>

<p>00:13:38:</p>

<p>I'm Onley responsible for the actual job that they're paying me to do.</p>

<p>00:13:47:</p>

<p>They're not paying me to maintain a python packages or maintaining Meteo or they're paying me too.</p>

<p>00:13:52:</p>

<p>Provide them with a transcription.</p>

<p>00:13:57:</p>

<p>And the developers that are using the tool that I have built are I mean, they're not paying me at all, but they're relying on me, too.</p>

<p>00:14:10:</p>

<p>Provide a level of knowledge and service about the platform, or about the system that I have created all while while having the ability to take it and make it their own because it is an open source.</p>

<p>00:14:25:</p>

<p>A pack same thing with render engine render engine by default as a static side generator is designed to be very flexible, but because I'm not selling static sites is a service.</p>

<p>00:14:45:</p>

<p>I'm only providing a system for generating sites.</p>

<p>00:14:52:</p>

<p>That is a level of insight that I don't have to provide.</p>

<p>00:14:56:</p>

<p>I don't have to teach people proper SEO.</p>

<p>00:14:59:</p>

<p>I don't have to teach people proper CDN usage and compression of images and things like that.</p>

<p>00:15:05:</p>

<p>My system does not care about these things.</p>

<p>00:15:09:</p>

<p>It does not benefit them anyway.</p>

<p>00:15:11:</p>

<p>The only way that we were able to integrate sire like a search capability, like for those who don't know, one of the big achievements of he had this year for render engine is the integration in with a fuse dot Js, which is a static site search.</p>

<p>00:15:30:</p>

<p>Um, that's all done on the client side.</p>

<p>00:15:34:</p>

<p>Basically, you supply a JavaScript package with a JSON Output and you can search that file poor content.</p>

<p>00:15:46:</p>

<p>Now they're probably better ways to do it.</p>

<p>00:15:50:</p>

<p>I'm sure you could offload that to another service, but my assumption is if you're building static sites, you have a certain thought about offloading stuff to third party service.</p>

<p>00:16:07:</p>

<p>Um, but, you know, part of my thought pattern was Do I want to support looter?</p>

<p>00:16:14:</p>

<p>Another static site search engine do I want to support, um, elastic search and do I want to support?</p>

<p>00:16:23:</p>

<p>You know, Al Gore, Uh, or out was What is it?</p>

<p>00:16:28:</p>

<p>Yeah, Al Gore as either Algora or Algoria.</p>

<p>00:16:31:</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>

<p>00:16:31:</p>

<p>I think it's Algora.</p>

<p>00:16:33:</p>

<p>And because I wasn't saying, "Hey, everybody, here's a platform that, you know, you give me $10 a month and I host your static site."</p>

<p>00:16:45:</p>

<p>And there's nothing wrong with people that are doing that.</p>

<p>00:16:47:</p>

<p>You know, shout out to the whole micro.blog service and Manton Reese and Jene McDonald and the other people that are a part of making that a reality.</p>

<p>00:16:56:</p>

<p>Um, that's just not me.</p>

<p>00:16:58:</p>

<p>That's just not what I'm aiming to do.</p>

<p>00:17:01:</p>

<p>I would much rather make sure stuff that I'm doing is compatible with what they're doing.</p>

<p>00:17:06:</p>

<p>And they have really made that easy.</p>

<p>00:17:07:</p>

<p>So again, big shout out to them.</p>

<p>00:17:12:</p>

<p>So I guess in this rambling that is kind of my big take away in this whole conversation is there's something to say about the idea of controlling the scope of your projects, and that is something that I am learning more and more of as I get older and as I want to do more things while having more responsibilities is, I have to be able to control the scope of what I'm doing.</p>

<p>00:17:50:</p>

<p>So the big pit question for you that I want to hear about, whether it's on Twitter or whether you want to email me at info it productivity in tech dot com is how are you controlling the scope of the things that you're doing?</p>

<p>00:18:13:</p>

<p>And furthermore, what can you do in order to begin controlling the scope of some things that might have gotten out of control?</p>

<p>00:18:30:</p>

<p>I'm gonna leave it there because the last, you know, five minutes or so of this little podcast thing, it's going to be devoted to a little bit of, ah administration work here.</p>

<p>00:18:45:</p>

<p>So I've been thinking more and more about Pitt as a community, as a group of people Maurin Mawr during this time with racial injustice and things like that happening.</p>

<p>00:19:04:</p>

<p>Have I not been more proud of the black community that I've been a part of, you know, obviously from birth, but also the vocal community and the amount of ally ship that I have around me and that has made me want to value the people within that community.</p>

<p>00:19:29:</p>

<p>More and more now, I'm still not sure how that involves pit, but what I have learned is that I want to be able to support of the things and the people that are doing amazing things more and more.</p>

<p>00:19:50:</p>

<p>And by doing that, I have to have the support of the community.</p>

<p>00:19:55:</p>

<p>So here is my I thought I would be willing toe have more conversations like this on a regular basis if there were some form of feedback one, there has to be feedback on it.</p>

<p>00:20:23:</p>

<p>I don't I don't mind shouting into the either, but the actual time it takes tow, edit and record this.</p>

<p>00:20:29:</p>

<p>And I mean, even the editing isn't much, but I cough a lot.</p>

<p>00:20:32:</p>

<p>I'm an asthmatic.</p>

<p>00:20:32:</p>

<p>I'm a chronic asthmatic.</p>

<p>00:20:34:</p>

<p>There's a lot of coughing that's involved in a lot of people.</p>

<p>00:20:36:</p>

<p>Sometimes here and then sometimes don't hear, depending on my mood.</p>

<p>00:20:43:</p>

<p>One.</p>

<p>00:20:44:</p>

<p>There's got to be feedback in the term and in actual like conversation.</p>

<p>00:20:51:</p>

<p>I'm only sharing this stuff with you because I want to start a conversation.</p>

<p>00:20:58:</p>

<p>If there's no desire for a conversation to be had then I have no reason to continues speaking about it.</p>

<p>00:21:10:</p>

<p>The other side is it has to make sense from a time value perspective.</p>

<p>00:21:18:</p>

<p>As some may noticed, I have upped the transparency of me searching for, um, I want to say a job, but searching for a way to provide for my family?</p>

<p>00:21:33:</p>

<p>No, I have a job.</p>

<p>00:21:36:</p>

<p>I'm not worried about getting fired today, at least, and pit is still growing.</p>

<p>00:21:43:</p>

<p>I mean, last year was the best year for pit, which I mean.</p>

<p>00:21:47:</p>

<p>Luckily, the company's only two years old, so you know, hopefully, hopefully we can continue moving in a positive direction.</p>

<p>00:21:58:</p>

<p>But the time that it takes to record this I'm currently sitting at 22 minutes, 39 seconds.</p>

<p>00:22:05:</p>

<p>I think on the actual recording, it's like 22 minutes, five seconds, something like that.</p>

<p>00:22:10:</p>

<p>But I was working on a transcription before I started doing this, and I said, You know what?</p>

<p>00:22:16:</p>

<p>I really need to get that thing done.</p>

<p>00:22:17:</p>

<p>So if I'm going to do more things like that, I need to make sure that I'm not taking away time from my family without it making sense from a from a value perspective.</p>

<p>00:22:37:</p>

<p>So what does that mean?</p>

<p>00:22:41:</p>

<p>Does that mean there's gonna be a patri on?</p>

<p>00:22:42:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:22:43:</p>

<p>Does that mean there's gonna be ah member full or something like that?</p>

<p>00:22:47:</p>

<p>No, I don't know what it means at the moment.</p>

<p>00:22:51:</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is one person.</p>

<p>00:22:56:</p>

<p>I'm looking for a couple things.</p>

<p>00:22:57:</p>

<p>I'm looking for two people to listen to this and tell me that they heard it.</p>

<p>00:23:02:</p>

<p>They enjoyed it or they heard it and they didn't enjoy it.</p>

<p>00:23:05:</p>

<p>And here's why.</p>

<p>00:23:06:</p>

<p>Or they heard it.</p>

<p>00:23:06:</p>

<p>And I'm an idiot or whatever.</p>

<p>00:23:09:</p>

<p>The other thing I want to hear is someone say I have heard this.</p>

<p>00:23:13:</p>

<p>I appreciate it.</p>

<p>00:23:15:</p>

<p>It brought me value.</p>

<p>00:23:17:</p>

<p>And I want to, in some way, shape or form compensate you for the value that you've put out.</p>

<p>00:23:27:</p>

<p>Now, if you feel like you can't afford that, by all means, I understand I'm not even saying that you have to feel obligated to give me money.</p>

<p>00:23:39:</p>

<p>I am saying that if this truly brings value to you and you feel like you would be willing to do something to ensure that this value continued to happen, I need to know, because otherwise all I'm doing is wasting my time and my energy putting something out there that no one's listening to now, the pit podcast as a whole.</p>

<p>00:24:07:</p>

<p>The interviews they will still happen because I enjoy.</p>

<p>00:24:09:</p>

<p>I enjoy the conversations.</p>

<p>00:24:12:</p>

<p>At the present time, I have five six interviews scheduled in like the next month.</p>

<p>00:24:24:</p>

<p>I can stretch those out for the remainder of the year, and that will be the entire pit season.</p>

<p>00:24:30:</p>

<p>Or I can release them on a bi weekly, maybe even weekly basis, like we used to back in the good old days.</p>

<p>00:24:40:</p>

<p>But I'm not going to do that at the stake of my sanity, knowing that it's not going to make an impact in anyone's life or knowing that the people who are consuming it are just using.</p>

<p>00:24:54:</p>

<p>It is background noise.</p>

<p>00:24:55:</p>

<p>I cannot do that.</p>

<p>00:24:57:</p>

<p>So here's the promise that I'm making today as I'm recording this and this will be released is June 10th.</p>

<p>00:25:05:</p>

<p>If by June 20th we have one pledge to somehow pay for this service, you know, pay for this podcast, not even not even monetarily.</p>

<p>00:25:21:</p>

<p>Maybe it's just in terms of like, Hey, I promise that if you put in episode, I will retweet it and I will reply with a comment.</p>

<p>00:25:30:</p>

<p>I am okay with that being the currency.</p>

<p>00:25:33:</p>

<p>I love your money.</p>

<p>00:25:34:</p>

<p>But if you don't have it, I understand.</p>

<p>00:25:37:</p>

<p>Some of us just don't have it.</p>

<p>00:25:40:</p>

<p>And if I have two people that can just say Hey, you know what?</p>

<p>00:25:44:</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>

<p>00:25:45:</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the thought piece.</p>

<p>00:25:47:</p>

<p>This is what I did like.</p>

<p>00:25:48:</p>

<p>This is what I didn't like.</p>

<p>00:25:49:</p>

<p>Maybe a little too much preaching at the end.</p>

<p>00:25:53:</p>

<p>Whatever it is.</p>

<p>00:25:55:</p>

<p>10 days.</p>

<p>00:25:57:</p>

<p>I will talk about this every single day.</p>

<p>00:25:59:</p>

<p>I will tweet it out every single day.</p>

<p>00:26:01:</p>

<p>I will give it my full up.</p>

<p>00:26:03:</p>

<p>Do a transcription for it.</p>

<p>00:26:05:</p>

<p>I will do everything possible to make sure that people hear this.</p>

<p>00:26:13:</p>

<p>And if again, two people tell me, Give me some feedback.</p>

<p>00:26:19:</p>

<p>One person pledges some type of either money or effort in terms of a currency.</p>

<p>00:26:27:</p>

<p>Then I will continue to do this and I will pledge to release the episodes that I'm recording at a bi weekly basis.</p>

<p>00:26:33:</p>

<p>Starting out if we get more than that and I feel like I can truly start doing this on a weekly basis, then by all means, that's awesome.</p>

<p>00:26:40:</p>

<p>But if not, I have to think about the effort that I'm putting in, and I have to think about the find that it's taking away from my family and things like that.</p>

<p>00:26:54:</p>

<p>I have no problem with it.</p>

<p>00:26:55:</p>

<p>My family has no problem with it, but ultimately we and by we I mean me.</p>

<p>00:27:02:</p>

<p>I I want to share this content with you, but I don't want it to fall on deaf ears, and I don't want it to just be background noise for someone's commute.</p>

<p>00:27:12:</p>

<p>I want to be something that they take in and that they value.</p>

<p>00:27:15:</p>

<p>So that's my pledge to you.</p>

<p>00:27:16:</p>

<p>Like I said, two pieces of feedback.</p>

<p>00:27:18:</p>

<p>One pledge.</p>

<p>00:27:19:</p>

<p>If you can make that happen, then the podcasts interviews will go on a biweekly schedule, and I will probably supplement the interviews with more thoughts like this, just less preachiness on the back end.</p>

<p>00:27:31:</p>

<p>But that's gonna do it for this week.</p>

<p>00:27:33:</p>

<p>I have been your, um, speaker and your hose J.</p>

<p>00:27:39:</p>

<p>Miller.</p>

<p>00:27:39:</p>

<p>If you want to reach out to me, there's a couple ways you can do it.</p>

<p>00:27:43:</p>

<p>You can A) hit me up on Twitter.</p>

<p>00:27:45:</p>

<p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller">@kjaymiller</a>.</p>

<p>00:27:48:</p>

<p>You can B) email me at info at productivityintech dot com, or C) You could go to my website <a href="https://kjaymiller.com">kjaymiller.com</a>.</p>

<p>00:27:57:</p>

<p>Uh, there might be a contact button there.</p>

<p>00:28:00:</p>

<p>There might not be?</p>

<p>00:28:01:</p>

<p>No, actually.</p>

<p>00:28:02:</p>

<p>Now, you can't really do that when there's no contact button.</p>

<p>00:28:04:</p>

<p>I'm also a microdot.</p>

<p>00:28:05:</p>

<p>Blawg at KJ.</p>

<p>00:28:07:</p>

<p>Why Miller, if you use microdot block instead of Twitter.</p>

<p>00:28:10:</p>

<p>But if you want to be invited into our privates like channel, I'll bet you.</p>

<p>00:28:15:</p>

<p>But if I like, If I like the cut of your jib, then sure, we'll bring you in.</p>

<p>00:28:21:</p>

<p>Um, once we have enough, people will start an open conversation about how we can make this work financially.</p>

<p>00:28:31:</p>

<p>I'm open to doing more things like this, whether they're a live stream, whether we're having, like, voice, call, conversation, stuff or whatever.</p>

<p>00:28:40:</p>

<p>But more than anything, I just want to make sure that people are hearing this and that people are getting something out of it.</p>

<p>00:28:46:</p>

<p>But that's gonna do it for this time.</p>

<p>00:28:49:</p>

<p>I'm Jay Miller.</p>

<p>00:28:49:</p>

<p>Thank you so much for listening.</p>

<p>00:28:52:</p>

<p>Uh, thank you to Nadir Omowale for the use of his music a "hustler in spite of myself" for the intro and outro music.</p>

<p>00:28:59:</p>

<p>And of course, I hope for the last 29 minutes and five seconds that we have been productive.</p>

<p>00:29:06:</p>

<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p>00:29:08:</p>

<p>I will talk to you next time.</p>

<title>I Was Selected as a Mentee for the First Podcast Mentorship Cohort</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a firm believer that it is incredibly hard to be a <em>self taught</em> anything.</p>

<p>In fact one of the <strong>easiest</strong> ways to learn is sharing and learning from others.</p>

<p>That's why I'm happy to announce I'll be doing just that as a member of the
first cohort of the <a href="https://www.podcastmentorship.net">Podcast Mentorship Program</a>), imagined by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">Myke
Hurley</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/analogue/178">Analog(ue)</a> Myke
announced he was launching a mentorship program. I was hesitant to sign up as
I've been podcasting for about 5 years now.</p>

<p>Here's something that I recently came to terms with thanks to a great
conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieyo">Brian Douglas</a>. </p>

<h3>You need to let people help you.</h3>

<p>Myke has a decade of experience in podcasting. Many of the people that I
interview on the show have been doing what they are doing professionally for
many years and have the experience of that journey to help them grow.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/671c723f">interview with Tom Merritt</a>, he
covers a secret to his success as a community builder and podcaster. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at CNet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could all follow the steps of Tom here and get a string of jobs where you learn from
years of experience or we can learn from their years of experience and shave
off incredible amounts of time.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning with and from all of the amazing people (all who are at
different places in their career).</p>

<p>Check out each of the members and their projects.

a team of folks built this beautiful dashboard to highlight the disparity of
violenve in Black communities in NYC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope that with this information, people gain a greater understanding of the disparities present in our society.</p>

<title>Fish Resources</title>  <description><![CDATA[<div class="notification is-dark">
<div class="content">
<h2 class="has-text-light">Update:</h2>
<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<p>I do a lot of work in the terminal. I understand that for many it's the lack of glitz and glamour that keeps people away from it, and while the majority of my computer usage is in some GUI, there are still many things that I can do much faster using a script that I can launch from my terminal.</p>

<p>Fish (Short for Friendly Interactive Shell) was a great attempt to add some modern-ness to the terminal environment. That said it has been around since the 90's as this boutique experience that some love, many ignore, and even more fear. </p>

<p>Well, fear not. Here are a few links that can help introduce you to fish and help you get out the gate quickly.</p>

<title>Announcing Transcriptor</title>  <description><![CDATA[<h2>This was the launch month for [Transcriptor]. This is a helper package that I use for doing transcriptions for PIT Clients.</h2>

<p>Transcriptions can be accomplished in a plethora of ways, but in order to do it, you need to have a good idea of how to work with the results from your transcription engine. While I usually use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a>, I have used <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/">Google Could Services Speech to Text</a> and I would love to look into the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.Ai</a>. All of these systems use their own schema for your task and your results.</p>

<p>The goal of transcriptor is to create a single Job object that is responsible (currently) for handling the results in a consistent object-oriented way. By using it, I've been able to create some clarity in my coding projects for folks and reduced the amount of copying and pasting across the board.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Can you use it?</em> <strong>At your own risk, sure.</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it documented?</em> <strong>Not Yet</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it stable?</em> <strong>I wouldn't say that...</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it open source?</em> <strong>Of course it is!</strong></li>
<li><em>Am I accepting contributions</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>I am accepting testing and documentation PRs, I'm also looking at incoming issues and If you have a fix (Not a Feature Request), I will accept after testing and reviews.</p>

<title>Introducing the What I&#39;m Podcast!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the past few weeks, I've been working on getting another (Yes another Podcast) up and running. In the spirit of "JUST DO IT ALREADY!!", I have launched the <a href="https://kjaymiller.transistor.fm"><em>What I'm Podcast</em></a></p>

<p>The podcast is an extension of the "What I'm" Section on the home page. I've always liked letting people know what I've been up to and I hope with this I'll be able to flex my creativity muscles with this show.</p>

<p><a href="https://kjaymiller.transistor.fm/episodes/i-ve-been-sick-i-must-have-caught-the-apple-bug">Episode 1</a> is up and I am putting together content to determine if this will be a weekly update or more frequently. </p>

<p>I'm actively keeping this podcast off of major networks in effort to convice people that ultimately, you don't need to really on the heavy hitters like <em>Spotify</em> and <em>Apple</em>. You can subscribe via this <a href="https://feeds.transistor.fm/what-i-m-podcast-with-jay-miller">rss link</a>. </p>

<title>PIT Podcast: Effectively Doing a Lot with Tom Merritt</title>  <description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/671c723f"></iframe>

<p>Jay 00:00:20:</p>

<p>What's up everybody? J. Miller here bringing another productivity's intact podcast. I hope that your day has been great, and I hope that the conversation that I'm about tohave will make it even better on the line with me Today I have the host of the I Don't know if it's the first, but it is definitely in the</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:42:</p>

<p>1st 3 podcasts that I ever listened to. Um, Tom married. He is the host of the daily Take New show. He is also the co host work Insanity. Current Geek East Meets West. He is a published author of The Pilot X Series, the second book Trigger, Now available for digital download. And he is also a contributor to Tech Republic.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:08:</p>

<p>Tom, Did I get Everything</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:11:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:11:</p>

<p>know, But I do weigh too much. And to be honest, it would be ridiculous to expect you</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:16:</p>

<p>to get everything that covers more than enough. Thank you for having me, man.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:20:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And Tom is one of the few people that have been on this show more than once. Ah, he was actually a guest on what we call the before times</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:31:</p>

<p>in that initial feed that was lost. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:34:</p>

<p>I have always looked up to you, Tom, as</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:39:</p>

<p>the</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:42:</p>

<p>like, the idea of professionalism in podcasting, whether it is the stories of, like, I think, um, smr podcast Folks have said like</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:52:</p>

<p>we have to jump in the call like, an hour early. We're going through nodes and everybody's got cues. And everything's, like all synchronized and and, you know, working with producers and and just jumping on board with patri on at a really early stage and and allowing that to</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:10:</p>

<p>basically go from an empire with Was it seen at that you were with or</p>

<p>Tom 00:02:16:</p>

<p>I was with Seen it for 2004 through 2010? Yeah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:21:</p>

<p>I feel like the knowledge that I have on this is like nard war level? Probably not. Nor, uh, are you familiar with not, uh what is it? Nard war? No. What's Nard war? He is a Vancouver Ah, deejay that interviews like a lot of hip hop artists and the level of research that he goes through is absolutely scary at times. He's like, back in 1991 when you were, you know, doing you know, freestyles in the Bronx. You took this picture with run d m C And what were those shoes that you're aware? And he's like, Oh, you were wearing these? Yeah, I've brought a pair of those for you today.</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:02:</p>

<p>Like, Yeah, it's crazy. The scary thing is, I didn't have to do any research. Like, you are very good at what you do in that</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:14:</p>

<p>People know what Europe Teoh. They know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:18:</p>

<p>like I'm always finding something new that you've done. And then I'm like, Okay, Wow. Like here. Here's this thing. And then I immediately start following it for years and years and years. Uh, can you say that that's, like, kind of the gist of Of the</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:36:</p>

<p>I don't want to say, like your product or your brand Is that</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:40:</p>

<p>do you think it's more like, Hi, I'm Tom Merit of DCNS fame. Or is it or is it now? Like I am Tom Merit and the people that know me know me.</p>

<p>Tom 00:03:49:</p>

<p>Yeah, well, so thanks, man. Appreciate all the kind words I really don't know. It's something I'm always struggling to figure out is you know, what is that position? Ah, that is most common. I generally think it's probably host of daily tech new show because that is the show that I have with the largest number of listeners, and so it's more likely that somebody knows me from that</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:11:</p>

<p>than anything else. And it is the heir to tech news today and buzz out loud, which were similar shows that I did before. So I sort of feel like when I have to introduce myself in a short period of time or if someone just asked me like, What's your show? And I don't want to get into, You know, all the side projects I have. I'll just say Daily technician Usually</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:32:</p>

<p>I forgot one. It's a thing, another</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:36:</p>

<p>that probably launched three since we started talking. That's just you can never give up</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:42:</p>

<p>well, And that was something that, you know you mentioned earlier. Is that you? It's almost assigned that you do too much. Uh, how How are you balancing all of these different things?</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, it's something</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:58:</p>

<p>that I enjoy doing. I mean, that that is the key to all of it is that I have very carefully ah, whittled away the things I don't enjoy doing and have luckily been able to make what I enjoy doing my work, which then means I have to find time to do all the ideas that I have. And honestly, that's something I've only just recently solved because after I left twit Ah, and they replaced me. I had to start</p>

<p>Tom 00:05:26:</p>

<p>on my own. I started as many things as possible, figuring nal of them would stick. But I needed to, you know, have a bunch of irons in the fire and most of them stuck. So for a long time, I was like, I don't have any room in my schedule to make something new And it wasn't until I brought on help for mostly for daily Tech news show,</p>

<p>Tom 00:05:47:</p>

<p>but also for we're doing a reboot of of the current Keep podcast. Ah, for that as well that I loosened up enough to be able to say, Okay, now I can take some time away from time to time. Now I can have people you know, come in and and and do some of the heavy lifting, the producing, even script writing. Ah, and that allows me to kind of back off and be able to doom or without having to burn myself out. It was it was a big thing that had to be careful of was burned out. And the key to that was learning to let go where, you know, not even just trust, cause I trust all the people I work with just being able to say yes. Okay, I will. I will. I will let go of this, even though I enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:31:</p>

<p>You know, that's that's been something that,</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:34:</p>

<p>you know, you talked about burnout. Like I feel like burnout is one of those things. It's like a mental precursor to your body, physically burning out. Oh, yeah. Um, I kind of shared a little bit of the story with you, you know, beforehand. But like, it took my body literally breaking down for me to be like, Whoa, I need to dial things back a little bit and</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:57:</p>

<p>slowly reintroduce</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:00:</p>

<p>some of the things that I miss and that I enjoy. And even now, like, productivity in tech is one of those things that every time I'm like, we're going to go on a break like by a month, I'm just like I want to do more interviews. I want toe do something else. I want to bring it out.</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:18:</p>

<p>How have you prevented yourself from not starting projects. I know that's that. That's like the tough part, because, um I think Justin McElroy said it earlier this week on one of his podcast that he's now doing woodworking. But he doesn't want to talk about it, because if he talks about it to the Internet for more than Like a minute, there will be a new podcast for him,</p>

<p>Tom 00:07:38:</p>

<p>right? Ah, it's It's tough. I mean, part of it is like you say, realizing that if you put too much stress on yourself mentally, it will affect you physically. And you know it's on all too common story that you know, you you have to have a scare</p>

<p>Tom 00:07:56:</p>

<p>to make yourself adapt to. That s so keeping that in mind and paying attention to how you feel. Ah, and sort of associating, You know, if I take a break, if I take time off, if I don't do things, if I schedule things</p>

<p>Tom 00:08:13:</p>

<p>to give myself time off, I feel better, like just making that connection, forcing yourself to make that connection, eso that you're not overworking yourself and you're not feeling guilty. In my case, I would feel guilty like I should be working I should be doing these things. I have these things I want to do. I enjoy them. Why am I not doing them? And the key was to say, Because you'll you'll hurt yourself. If you do that right, it's It's like too much of a good thing is always a danger. Ah, and and so if you enjoy doing something that that's no exception So, yeah, I mean, a</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:44:</p>

<p>I don't know what</p>

<p>Tom 00:08:45:</p>

<p>the the trick is, but I've just sort of emphasized to myself that there have to be limits. There have to be and we talk about this on work, insanity a lot. There have to be beginnings and ends to the workday. There have to be breaks where I'm not working. Ah, and I've just worked really hard to to take advantage of that and give myself permission to do that</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:04:</p>

<p>Kind of, Ah, little tech. I guess nerd is something that I did. I use its will called keyboard maestro on my Mac and at quitting time. At my day job, I get a notification that says OK, timeto to wrap it up and it will start looking at what applications I have open and after two minutes. If I haven't closed all of like my community, my email, my communication, all that's up, it will promptly save everything and close them for me and say,</p>

<p>Tom 00:09:34:</p>

<p>Wow,</p>

<p>Tom 00:09:35:</p>

<p>that's intense. Yeah, you know, I mean, you got to do what you gotta do, right?</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:39:</p>

<p>Yeah, And I think that that's That's one of the things that, like you said When you enjoy the work that you do it, it does become hard to say. Okay, I'm gonna work until this time. And then after that, there are more important things that I need to tend to, like I have my wife and my daughter and, like I I want to.</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:59:</p>

<p>I have to be aware of the time that I'm taking away from them, because if I spend all day, you know, at my computer, then all of a sudden I go in. I'm like, Oh, what's for dinner? And then I look around. It's like, Oh, wait, why's everybody asleep? And that's just that's not</p>

<p>Jay 00:10:16:</p>

<p>good. It's not healthy. It's not healthy for my family. It's not healthy for me. Ah, it's It's one of those things that it takes again. It takes learning the hard way. Ah, before you're like, OK, whatever it takes for me to make sure that I go, I'm done right now.</p>

<p>Jay 00:10:33:</p>

<p>That's what I have to dio.</p>

<p>Tom 00:10:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, I've redirected some of my energy into things that will make me feel better entered and healthier. Eso You know, instead of going on to the next computer project, I'll get up and this, You know, the past couple of months, we we planted some carrots and tomatoes. So I go out and I work in the garden. And that gets me son because my doctors like you need vitamin D and and And then I get, you know, I've got a step count that I'm trying to hit. And then so that helps me get to that. And so, you know, I take some of that goal oriented behavior and and and try to redirect it into things that will help the problem rather than exacerbating it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:16:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And I wanted to talk about that. I mean, how do you approach new things? I know that you think when we first spoke, you were launching Pilot X, and now I mean you're launching treat well. You've launched trigger at this point. I think there's some weird shipping stuff going on. Do toe?</p>

<p>Tom 00:11:34:</p>

<p>Yeah. The book in the audiobook are out there, the print books. Still in a warehouse somewhere, I think. I think they're very close to being able to visit the warehouse safely, so hopefully those will start shipping.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:45:</p>

<p>Oh, man. Never thought you'd be would be having these kinds of numbers.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:50:</p>

<p>I can't get my books out of a warehouse. I mean, yeah, okay. It makes sense now, Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:55:</p>

<p>but yeah, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:57:</p>

<p>talk a little bit about, Like how That's very different than putting out a daily new show. Just the idea of didn't you Self published this one and the last one Or</p>

<p>Tom 00:12:08:</p>

<p>now Pilot X and Trigger are through a company called Inc Shares that is a traditional publisher, but they they use crowd sourcing for choosing the books. So you have to get a certain number of people to commit to buying the book ahead of time, and then you'll be ableto publish. And and then it works. Just like any other publisher with editors and marketing and all of that. Ah, but I did sell, publish a lot of others before and really with the books. It's just again. It's something. It's a sideline that I enjoy. I have a task for myself, too, right? Or edit every day. Ah, and so it's just built in that I'm always working on something, even if it's for 10 minutes. Ah, I just I'm always working on something. And then eventually I'll have Manu scripts and I'll want to share those. I want toe to put those out and find a way to get those into the hands of people that might want to read it,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:01:</p>

<p>including, you know, joining the ranks of of, I guess, jury fame with a free newsletter. And we're not free news that What was it Free? Tom's, Tom's</p>

<p>Tom 00:13:12:</p>

<p>three Top those letters dot com? Yeah, also, I mean really done at the behest of Justin Robbery of Jerry. Yeah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:19:</p>

<p>I need to get up. I've met. I've met jury once and alive show he did in San Diego with broken and it was funny and strange at the same time because we're both Harston players and I mean, you know, jury, it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:37:</p>

<p>as much of a character as he is. He's also kind of like</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:41:</p>

<p>Okay, cool. Everybody's happy I'm going to go like, take a breath and, like, step away and like you just catches me Playing Harston over in the corner is like, OK, and then, like that starts a whole conversation. I'm like, Yeah, great show data, data, data. Brian sucks sometimes because he supposed to been on this show like, three years ago. And he emailed me, like, two months ago. Like, hey was not supposed to do a thing</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:03:</p>

<p>that sounds like Brian This'll wasn't supposed to be a dig on Brian, but yeah, like it. It is so interesting. And one of the reasons why I wanted to kind of question the idea of, like, product versus brand waas</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:19:</p>

<p>You have put around you. Um and this is probably another question for, like, Scott Johnson who will have to have on the show and everyone else That's a part of this group. And, um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:29:</p>

<p>like I won't say the diamond club, but like diamond group frog pants, Like all of these ancillary groups that are around what you're doing,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:38:</p>

<p>it seems like there is a</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:42:</p>

<p>community that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:47:</p>

<p>almost like YouTube mega star esque in that</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:54:</p>

<p>you can talk about a thing such as folding at home, which, for those who don't know folding at home, was, ah, project where people could donate. Resource is on their own machine to help solve some of the algorithmic problems for figuring out a cure for covert 19 on. I think before that it was something else. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:15:</p>

<p>the team jumps in and then becomes, like breaks the top 100 of like groups within a matter of weeks. And</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:25:</p>

<p>it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:27:</p>

<p>there isn't really a</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:30:</p>

<p>demand or request from the Group it czar from the leaders of the group. It is usually Hey, we're doing a thing. If you want to join in, Here you go. Wow, look at how many of you joined in? Has that been something that you've</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:47:</p>

<p>you've kind of grown and nurtured over time? Or is it something that just kind of, like happened?</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:53:</p>

<p>Yeah, it's It's</p>

<p>Tom 00:15:54:</p>

<p>both, Ah, the the group of podcasters that I that I, you know, have on the show and communicate with and and and cross promote with those air friends, those air people that I'm like. I not only like you, but I like what you do. Ah, and and I think that's super important Ah, as part of it, Which is when I have Allison Sheridan on my show. When I have Chris Ashley on my show, when I have Scott Johnson on my show, you can tell that that we all respect and get along with each other. And I think that makes for better content that it really does. And then that, in turn, provides an example for the community building around all of these shows to be like OK, so they're respectful. They get along with each other. Uh, let's be the same lets you know, and people who don't really want to do that kind of wander often and and do something else I've said it before is you get the audience you deserve, which is, you know, maybe a little negative wayto to express that. But I think your audience is a reflection of your product of your show of of the of how you present yourself, um,</p>

<p>Tom 00:17:07:</p>

<p>and and the community that I have has long roots. I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at Cnet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:49:</p>

<p>Well, let's</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:51:</p>

<p>I want to give some some, like actual tangible help to those out there that might be thinking of following maybe not the tech news route, but</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:03:</p>

<p>building some form of community around content that they do. What What are some of those things that I guess people starting out</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:13:</p>

<p>need to be cognizant of and ultimately need to do to? I can't say to guarantee success because that's not possible. But Teoh truly give them the best possible</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:26:</p>

<p>chance at building something similar to what you've done.</p>

<p>Tom 00:18:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, some of it is luck, some of its longevity Ah, but but there there are some things I think I can pull out that might be useful to folks. Ah, and one is, you know, being genuine, being yourself being authentic. People will notice that they were, and then they will gather around that. And it will be very easy for you to maintain that because it's you Ah, and will help you avoid a lot of problems in the future because you are just being you. And so when you make mistakes, your audience will be more understanding because they know like, Oh, well, I understand him because he's always been or her or whatever. Ah, I understand them because they have been themselves with me. And so I I get what's going on, uh, also giving your community of voice. I think a super important, and it is as simple as reading emails. I mean, it could take all kinds of other forms. It could be Twitter and Instagram and Facebook groups and discords and slacks and and all of that, and those are all great ways to do it, too. But just giving your community of voice in what you do, I think, is super important. And that's one of the lessons I learned way back a tech TV like just reading someone's email on a show</p>

<p>Tom 00:19:41:</p>

<p>really does make their day. Ah, and they and they will become a fan forever</p>

<p>Tom 00:19:47:</p>

<p>in a lot of cases just because of that moment. But it also builds dialogue. And so it shouldn't just be one way. It's It should also, you know, you should be able to have conversations with people. And again it could just be over email, uh, or in chats or discords or whatever, but having</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:05:</p>

<p>some way to bring it your community into your show so that they feel a part of it. So they are a part of it and and also, uh, addressing people back so that they feel like you are, in fact listening for for at the beginning that's so easy. If you're starting out, you won't get overwhelmed. You won't have too many people writing in, so you can personally answer every email you get and</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:32:</p>

<p>you can be selective.</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:33:</p>

<p>You don't You don't have to read every single email on the show because you do want tohave. The feedback you include in the show be representative of the kind of feedback you'd want from your community. But if you're communicating back to people then you can explain that you could explain. Oh, the reason I didn't, you know, use your contribution was because of X, Y and Z.</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:51:</p>

<p>Sometimes that's</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:52:</p>

<p>difficult. Sometimes people will get upset and you have to be ready for that. That's part of community management, but it's it's really important to to try to do that. Ah, and to be transparent about how you're doing it so that people understand.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:07:</p>

<p>You know, I think one of the</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:09:</p>

<p>most memorable times for me was probably the first time that I felt like I had any type of knowledge to contribute</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:18:</p>

<p>to D. T and s And funny enough, who was actually from the morning stream because you were in Scott we're talking about, um I want to say it was e a removing the Tetris app from the APP store and I immediately e mailed in Onley because, like a week prior to that and I'm a big Tetris fan. Um but a week prior to that, I had watched like the to our long by, like, documentary Ah, Alexey pageant not who is the creator of Tetris and so still fresh in my mind. I had all of this knowledge. And I was like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:53:</p>

<p>I can't wait to tell like, you know, Tom and Scott both about Like, I forgot what I remember. There was, like, something that was stated. They were like, Oh, I wonder why they're doing this or what?</p>

<p>Tom 00:22:04:</p>

<p>How the Russian government makes money from Tetris?</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:06:</p>

<p>Exactly. And I was like, Yeah, I mean, Russia. It's still kind of makes a little bit off of that. But there has been the terrorist organization and everything else that now works with Alexey Pajitnov to help. Kind of</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:21:</p>

<p>make sure he's taking care of because he can't technically get paid from Tetris because he built it using</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:28:</p>

<p>equipment that he was using when he worked for the Russian government. Um, and in the end, I think the coolest part of that was the reply emails of just like Oh, that's cool. I did not know that. And then Scott saying Now I just want to play Tetris 99.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:44:</p>

<p>So I definitely agree that</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:47:</p>

<p>even when even when a reply like I knew my new my long winded response, there was no reason it ever needed to be aired because it was much more information than anyone could digest in, like, a couple of sentences. But just the fact that I knew that it was seen and I knew that it was responded to and it wasn't like, Oh, hey, great. Great insight. Thanks for the information. It was okay. Wow, This actually resonated Some kind of emotional feeling. And this is what that feeling Waas And to me, I thought that that meant the world to me in a way that I don't think that that you are Scot could ever imagine. Because that's what I was hoping. I was hoping that, like, I would strike a chord and be like, Oh, yeah, cool. That's awesome.</p>

<p>Tom 00:23:37:</p>

<p>Yeah. Yeah, well, and it's tough because they're gonna people be people who write in with something that they think is really important that maybe you you already know, right? Like like, if if you were doing this and someone wrote in to tell you about this this documentary about Tetris, you'd be like, Well, yeah, I already saw that. So, you know, it can be tricky. Yeah, you're not going to be able to make everybody's day all the time. Ah, but even when you just acknowledge it and And like I said, especially at the beginning, when you can like, I can't reply to every single person anymore. I try to I do read everything. I try to respond to his many as I can, but in the early times you can. And just that acknowledgement will help people, you know, really feel a part of your community.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:26:</p>

<p>Well,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:27:</p>

<p>I have enjoyed all of the different things that we have we've talked about, but I I would definitely want to give us enough time for this last question. Because</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:38:</p>

<p>you look a tech</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:40:</p>

<p>daily. You work with your community daily. You're trying new phones. You're trying new tools.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:49:</p>

<p>What is the state of tech for you these days? How are you feeling about</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:55:</p>

<p>how politicized technol technology companies air becoming how</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:00:</p>

<p>politicized? I guess everything is becoming these days, but that don't worry about that part. Um, but yeah, how</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:07:</p>

<p>when you look at new tech or new technology, do you think Oh, this is cool? Or do you think this is something that now I have to cover or I have to do because it's my job?</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:16:</p>

<p>Yeah, I I definitely love doing this. I love solving the puzzle of what goes in the show every day and and figuring out like what's really behind</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:27:</p>

<p>this or that story like today that the day that we're recording this and I know this will date this a little bit if you really pay attention. But, uh, they were recording this. Germany released their covert 19 app. Now I could have just said Germany released their their covert 19 contact tracing app and be done with it. But I also noticed that France</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:48:</p>

<p>was had recently had problems with their at because they were using a different platform. And I noticed that the European Union had announced they wanted to do a, ah, an interoperability project between all the different countries in Europe. And so it was funded to be like, Oh, these three stories are one story. How do I, you know, connect those dots? I just really enjoy doing that. And</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:12:</p>

<p>I feel like</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:14:</p>

<p>now I've been doing this long enough now feels, ah, lot like the early to mid two thousands because back in the early to mid two thousands, everybody was saying, Well, you know the dot com bust, That's it. You know what? What's gonna happen. There isn't anything new. These tech companies didn't work out. Ah, and that's a different thing that what we're experiencing now. But there's a similar flavor to it, which is, well, these tech companies, they're too big. They've stifled all the innovation. That's it. What do we do now? And to me, it's really exciting to be in that space where we don't know. We don't know what the next big new thing is gonna be. We don't know when the Google</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:56:</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:57:</p>

<p>Microsoft is goingto happen to Google. You know, like we these companies were the ones that disrupted the companies of the nineties. Now they're huge. Uh, who's going to disrupt them? And the fact that it's not obvious to me is exciting. It's not. It's not depressing. It's like we haven't seen him yet. It could come from anywhere. You know, the most recent thing. We have to point to his tic tac. Ah, and some people may roll their eyes and like a great chick talk, you know, a bunch of kids making videos. It's like, Yeah, but you were rolling your eyes at Facebook. If you were having that same approach in 2007. Ah, and look where that got us So I don't know it z me. It's It's super, it's super fun and it's super exciting to watch that story continue to unfold. And we're in the build up of suspense to know when the next twist is gonna happen.</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:49:</p>

<p>Well, I am personally looking forward to you covering that twist whenever it does happen, because again,</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:56:</p>

<p>de et nous, I love that you have put it in a place that it feels it feels stronger than it's ever been. It feels like it's definitely not going anywhere, anytime soon. And they even let you take a break every now and then to come on little shows like this.</p>

<p>Tom 00:28:15:</p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently been doing weekly reviews with my wife (GTD addicts calm down, not that kind of review). Mostly we just cover my schedule and plan our meals for the week. This has been amazing for us as it gets us on the same page and eliminates any last minute decisions. </p>

<p>Also, I'm not always thinking about what my wife has on her schedule. So this allows me to check the <em>Family Calendar</em> and make sure that anything that will impact the family or our routine is on there. I also put our weekly meal plan in OmniFocus with the tag: <em>Dinner</em>.</p>

<title>I Can&#39;t Be the Only One Seeing This</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>What are people yelling about?</p>

<p>I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to give a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regarding how their policy affected underrepresented groups. </p>

<p>The responses were:</p>

<ul>
<li>people praising the OP for their bravery</li>
<li>people shouting "What about candidate z?"</li>
<li>people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do</li>
<li>People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their own agenda</li>
</ul>

<p>The fear I have is, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at. In the end NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED.</p>

<p>I don't even know looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity? ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZbUOH7pbDiNSmU1x4o/giphy.gif" alt="My thoughts" /></p>

<p>I'm considering checking out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networking opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth dealing with the things I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. </p>

<ul>
<li>Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity</li>
<li>Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis</li>
<li>Cats doing amazing tricks</li>
<li>Videos of people failing so hard</li>
<li>Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques</li>
<li>Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle</li>
<li>People motivation folks around them that are crying out for help</li>
<li>People crying out for help!</li>
<li>People that are openly doubt their knowledge but are still putting themselves out there because they hope people will support them.</li>
<li>People building things to learn and are wanting feedback</li>
<li>People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems</li>
</ul>

<p>The guys at <a href="https://internetfriends.show">Internet Friends</a> proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.</p>

<p>"I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day."</p>

<p>To expand on that, I would love it so that you can only see the replies. If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.</p>

<p>I've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). </li>
<li>I'm tired of being told to yell at people. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm just SO TIRED. 😭</p>

<p>Dear Social Media Companies:
    I don't care about followers anymore.</p>

<pre><code>Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. 

I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line. 

Don't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?
</code></pre>

<p>Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. </p>

<p>I'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.</p>

<p>I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.</p>

<p>The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. </p>

<p>... OK BOOMER ...</p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the Quarantine, I've been goign on two weekly walks with a couple of PIT
Premium Members.</p>

<p>This allows me to do a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Catch up/Learn more with members of my community</li>
<li>Get some exercise</li>
<li>Vent about whatever it is I need to vent about.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been struggling to keep weight off as my asthma has been worsening with
the weight gain. If my friends are not available, I tend to take this route
with my headphones in and use the time to decompress or just think about
things. Also the time away from my computer really helps.</p>

<title>Quickly Set Your Environment with Bunch and Alfred</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/">Bunch</a> is an environment setup/teardown tool by the <a href="https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/episodes/podcast-ground-surfing-with-brett-terpstra">mad genius and yoga maestro of the internet</a> Brett Terpstra.</p>

<p>Bunch uses small configuration files to quickly manipulate your desktop environment. </p>

<p>With it you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open/Close/Focus Applications, Files, and URLs</li>
<li>Run shell and Applescript scripts to expand the functionality event more</li>
</ul>

<p>Because I prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard and the Application's main method of use is the Dock, I opted to take advantage of Bunch's URL-Scheme. </p>

<pre><code>x-bunch://open?bunch=[Bunch Name]
</code></pre>

<p>This plus smart use of the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/"><em>File Filter</em></a> in Alfred's workflow feature allowed me to quickly setup an <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Alfred Workflow</a> that not only lets you run your bunches but also lets you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display the Config File of the Bunch.</li>
<li>Edit the Bunch in your default application.</li>
<li>Refresh your Bunches (After making a change)</li>
</ul>

<p>The workflow is available on <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/bunch-quick-launch">Packal</a> to modify via my <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Github Repo</a></p>

<title>In Defense of the Black Multi-Potentialite</title>  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><em>Stay in Your Lane.</em> - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors</p>
  
  <p><em>Shut up and Dribble.</em> - Laura Ingraham</p>
  
  <p><em>Why does every black actor gotta rap some. I don't know. All I know is I'm the best one.</em> - Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.</p>

<p>For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.</p>

<p>For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. </p>

<p>I joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>But Why</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what is a man, what has he got?</p>
  
  <p>If not himself, then he has naught</p>
  
  <p>To say the things he truly feels</p>
  
  <p>And not the words of one who kneels</p>
  
  <p>The record shows, I took the blows</p>
  
  <p>And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. </p>

<p>In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.</p>

<p>When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).</p>

<p>In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.</p>

<h3>I do a lot.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I work a Day job.</li>
<li>I manage a <a href="https://productivityintech.com">side business</a> helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller">write code</a>.</li>
<li>I host a range of <a href="/projects">podcasts</a> from tech to gaming.</li>
<li>I'm a member of an Esports organization and <a href="https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller">stream regularly</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My <em>coding</em> skills help me <strong>automate</strong> and <strong>optimize</strong> my day job.</p>

<p>My <em>day job</em> skills, challenge me to <strong>think differently</strong> and <strong>shake up stale thought</strong>.</p>

<p>My <em>podcasting</em> and <em>streaming</em> skills gave me the ability to identify ways that <strong>I could help my
side-business clients</strong> in <strong>their</strong> content-creating journey.</p>

<p>They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. </p>

<p>I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. </p>

<p>Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.</p>

<p>Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.</p>

<p>My child will grow up seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.</p>
