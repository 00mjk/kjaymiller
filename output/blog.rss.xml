<title>2: When You Can’t Even (Or Odd)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>There were plenty of times when our hosts were incredibly stressed last 2 weeks. We weren't the only ones. Based on a request from one of our conductors (our listeners), we came to talk about how we manage to be productive when we can't even (or odd).</p>

<title>Introducing DiversityOrgs.Tech</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Okay Time to Share something I've been working on for the last month. Introducing https://diversityorgs.tech.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wanted to build something that did a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Created a place where underrepresented folks in tech could find groups that wanted to represent them.</li>
<li>Create a resource for new underrepresented folks and allies could learn how to get connected.</li>
<li>Build something fun and simple with technology that I haven't played around with too much.</li>
</ol>

<p>Diversityorgs.tech does all these things.</p>

<hr />

<p>To use it, simply search. You can search for things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>your city, state, territory, or region</li>
<li>the group in which you identify with (or wish to support)</li>
<li>A technology, focus or stack</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I don't do anything like require user accounts. There's no cookies, trackers and I have none of your information, nor do I want it. There's no need for that. This site is pretty lightweight and free. </p>

<p>It's just the beginning so there are only about 150 organizations that have been added (most around the python space because that's where I operate).</p>

<hr />

<p>I desperately want to add more orgs to this and create some interesting features. That said it's easy to add organizations, but not always easy to find. If you represent an organization and would like it added to this. Please:</p>

<p>A. Message/DM me on twitter
B. Use this link to submit your org through the app - https://diversityorgs.tech/addorg</p>

<title>5 People That Made My 2021 📈</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Normally awards like this are reserved for the very last post of the year, but as I'm hoping to fulfill my commitment on <a href="https://relay.fm/conduit/12">Conduit</a> and try not to work on my time off<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p><a href="./five-people-that-made-2020-fire">Last year</a> I did the <strong>Jay-sies</strong> as a way to highlight some people in my life that have really impacted and encouraged me. My goal is to showcase 5 friends and let them know how amazing they are!</p>

<p>These are not in any order because I don't rank my friends.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/webology">Jeff Triplett</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/webology.jpg" alt="Jeff Triplett" /></p>

<p>I was surprised that Jeff wasn't on my list last year. I owe my job to him<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Jeff has been consistently awesome so I'm going to give him the nod this year for sure!</p>

<p>When I moved into tech, there were a lot of things I didn't know. Jeff is my advisor in many ways. He is also my late night coding buddy, a sharer of many new tools and someone that entertains all of my crazy thoughts and works to turn them into minimum viable ideas<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/mrssoup">Kathy Campbell</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/mrssoup.jpg" alt="Kathy Campbell" /></p>

<p>The Homie! The partner in crime. The person other than my spouse that puts up with the most 💩 from me!</p>

<p>Kathy and I started <a href="https://relay.fm/conduit">Conduit</a> this year and it's been a blast getting to know her better. She inspires me to improve my community management skills (and my writing skills 😉). Kathy, I can truly say you have helped make dreams come true for me! Thank you for that.</p>

<p>Also, don't let her know that she's a total badass and is going to continue to grow in the space and I'm so jealous at times!</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/heyscottyj">Scotty Jackson</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/nestedfolderspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scotty.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Scotty Jackson" /></p>

<p>The pattern of people that I talk to on a regular basis continues! Scotty and I talk almost daily and share in our journey of productivity! </p>

<p>When I started talking about productivity on the internet I hoped I could have amazing conversations with people that pushed me to be more productive! Scotty is the embodiment of the person I imagined having regular conversations with.</p>

<p>BAM!</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/verso">Kelly Guimont</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/kellyguimont.jpeg" alt="Kelly Guimont" /></p>

<p>Kelly is my reality check in many ways! She is someone that I looked at as a podcaster and thought, "Wow! It would be great to work with someone like that and produce regular amazing content!". Nowadays, I build and help build automations for Kelly and help her produce that regular amazing content!</p>

<p>Kelly thank you for the ideas on home automation! Helping me develop my explaining skills and always knowing about the new hotness in apple accessory gadgets.</p>

<h2>Blue Sky Dragon</h2>

<p><em>No Image in Respect to Privacy</em></p>

<p>Oh Sky..... </p>

<p>I hope Sky knows how amazing they are. Listening to their fascination with math[s] and their inquisitiveness and fascination with many of the things I enjoy as well. Their show <a href="https://anchor.fm/find-my-dragon">Find My Dragon</a> quickly became one of my favorite new shows in 2021.</p>

<p>I wanted to add Sky because the journey is just begining for them. They are someone that I am intrigued by in many ways. I would love to do a <em>Rec Diffs</em>-style show with them one day in the future!</p>

<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p>These folks were close but I didn't add for personal reasons. They could be added in the future.</p>

<title>Your Taunt Carnage will be Televised</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Your Taunt Comp Carnage will be Televised</b></p><em><br />A few things I can think of are to quit rolling so much. Just look for upgrades to you board by either swapping out minions or buffing ones you think might stick around for a while. When there are only 5/6 players left in the lobby don’t take risky plays. Try to maximize your position to eliminate one more player or survive long enough to make it to top 4. Don’t force a comp or tribe. Let the build come to you. Try to better understand solid midrange builds. Taunts are very good for top 4 right now. They rarely finish first but tend to have some staying power in the early game. The comp is pretty easy to assemble right now as well</em><p><strong><br />Topics</strong><br />- Quit rolling so much<br />- Look for upgrades to your board<br />- Try to better understand solid midrange builds.</p><p><strong><br />Is this a Taunt Comp?!

<title>My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been on a tear with new podcasts, live streams, and communities.</p>

<p>My secret is these are all <em>cries for help</em>. </p>

<p>Not in a life threatening way, but in the stuck in an axiety induced feedback loop. </p>

<p><img src="https://questionablecontent.net/comics/3953.png" alt="Questionable Content Comic by Jeph Jacques" /></p>

<p>I've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more <em>fatalistic</em> and irrational towards things not going according to plan. </p>

<h3>Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?</h3>

<p><em>HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW</em></p>

<p>It just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. </p>

<p>I will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.</p>

<h3>Why are you telling us this?</h3>

<p>I'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. </p>

<p>It took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>

<p>I understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. </p>

<title>I was on a Bullet Journal Roundtable</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently a guest on the Tekside Networks <a href="https://www.tekside.net/gtdjedi">GTD Jedi Podcast</a> with my <a href="https://www.tekside.net/tektok">TekTok</a> cohosts Clay and Colin for a roundtable covering bullet journaling.</p>

<p>I was happy to meet fellow BuJo User <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurabroder/?hl=en">Laura Broder</a>. We seem like two folks cut from a very similar cloth. </p>

<p>I'm seeing more people investing in hybridism and the overall feeling that analog bullet journaling doesn't seem to fit in many folks digital workflow.</p>

<p>In my tribe I feel like a loner as most folks feel they need new tricks and tools to make bullet journaling work. That said I feel like there is still a (decreasing) audience for folks that need to keep their life and productivity contained in a notebook.</p>

<title>May 2020 - Monthly Catchup</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is also available via my <a href="https://buttondown.email/productivityintech">Newsletter</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Monthly Catchup</h1>

<p>Speaking of Ketchup, here are some <a href="https://sharedappetite.com/recipes/10-creative-artisan-ketchup-flavors/">Artisan Ketchup Ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>Productivity in Tech Podcast</h2>

<p>This month on the [PIT Podcast] I interviewed my good internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl">Christina Morrillo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/pit-v3.jpg" alt="pit podcast" /></a></p>

<h2>The Biz</h2>

<p>Business has been good. I'll be talking about this in my [premium newsletter] where I break down how I run my business, the workflows the code, the everything (but the clients). </p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>"<em>In these Troubled Times</em>" 🤮</p>

<p>Just Kidding. Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. </p>

<p>I've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.</p>

<p>This Month, I purchased <a href="https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a>. I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other <a href="https://devontechnologies.com">DevonTechnologies</a> Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/CleanShot-2020-05-25-at-23.34.03.png" alt="DevonThink" /></p>

<h2>Posts</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://kjaymiller.com/quick_productivity_tip_-_walk_and_talks">Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kjaymiller.com/qtp-family-agenda">Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Render Engine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my [personal blog]</li>
<li>Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.</li>
<li>Support for Categories and Tags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcriptor</h3>

<p>I launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. </p>

<h3>Episde-DL</h3>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/">Episode-DL</a> is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.</p>

<h3>Following Me</h3>

<p>You can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>If you have an RSS Reader that you use. Consider Subscribing to my [Blog] or [Microblog].</p>

<title>Telling The Server User Story Through The Elastic Stack</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Elastic has an ecosystem of products that to tell a story around both internal and external data. Companies use the Elastic Stack to gain insight on websites, businesses, and products. Diversityorgs.tech allows guests to search for diversity-focused orgs in their area. We’ll look at web traffic and examine trends in orgs searched. I'll explain ingesting that data from NGINX logs using Beats. We’ll look at analytics from Elastic App Search and visualize this information with Kibana. Finally, we'll use that information to implement a new feature giving people requests based on their perceived area, ALL WHILE REQUIRING NO COOKIES OR TRACKING FROM OUR USERS.</p>

<title>Reinvent the Wheel (But Add Spikes to It)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In my quest to grow as a python developer I learned a lot from reinventing the wheel.

His daily show ran for several months, but then seemed to come to an end.</p><p>In fact Chad seemed to have just fallen off the map. That is why I was excited to not only hear that he was returning to the tech podcasting world, but with a brand new venture, <a href="https://careerdesignpatterns.com/">Career Design Patterns</a>.</p><p>In this conversation, Chad and I talk about both of our hiatus' from the tech world as well as break down what his new journey is all about.</p><p><strong><br />What is Career Design Patterns<br /></strong><br /></p><p>Just like with PIT, Career Design Patterns focuses on building well rounded developers. This doesn’t mean knowing multiple languages. It more revolves around developers being able to strengthen their “dynamic skills” (also referred to as soft skills) using repeatable models that can be practiced and improved on.</p><p>He also hopes to connect people with professionals in the areas of productivity, effective team communication, and other areas that allow him to be the <em>tour guide</em> to your career progression and growth.</p><p><strong><br />Connect with Chad<br /></strong><br /></p><ul>

<p>Jay 00:00:17:</p>

<p>lots of everybody. J. Miller here back with another productivity in tech podcast. I hope you're having a fantastic week and mine just got a little bit better because I have the wonder and privilege to talk to someone that I have known for</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:36:</p>

<p>God like six years now And one of the first people I met when I became a programmer Ah always brings a smile to my face to see them Talks are absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And also just a generally overall just glowing person. Not because the radioactive, but because they just know how to brighten up a room. I am talking with the one the only Melanie crutch build. Melanie is so good to see you.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:09:</p>

<p>Wow, I The glowing, I think is like I think this is just fire of, like, embarrassment on my face now because you know</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:19:</p>

<p>the first of a nice say, like San Diego wildfires like G, it's like, well, not really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:24:</p>

<p>know Now I think it</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:26:</p>

<p>started. I guess so,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're we're hanging in there so far like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:33:</p>

<p>it's funny. It didn't quite into my consciousness that we have like yet another plague that we could layer onto 2020 like he's, you know, like of the seven layer salad of For that, 2020 is becoming like fires. I almost forgot, J thank you.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:54:</p>

<p>Under, I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:55:</p>

<p>guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:57:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:58:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bless it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jay 00:02:00:</p>

<p>Yes. So other than the obvious, um, perils that air plaguing America right now. How have you been? Generally?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:12:</p>

<p>Uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:13:</p>

<p>yeah. Well,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:16:</p>

<p>um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:18:</p>

<p>okay, so my my measurements of how I'm doing might be slightly different than the average person. Like if I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:30:</p>

<p>and awake</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:32:</p>

<p>and I have clothes on my body Bonus bonus. Both of those air working today, I have fed my cells.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:41:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:44:</p>

<p>yeah, and I got a couple of things done today. I mean, that's like, I'm like, living my best life</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:50:</p>

<p>at that point.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:54:</p>

<p>because, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:56:</p>

<p>it is, uh, often that those are not my days. You know, um, that they don't quite look like that because of, um because I have major depressive disorder. Um, I also have, like a really fun and exciting relationship with migraines, So there's that I have the anxiety. I have epilepsy, which is is fun,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:23:</p>

<p>that it's well controlled, so it's not as it's not as interesting or imitating as it might be. otherwise so, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:31:</p>

<p>but the, you know, the depression really gives you a completely different, um, scale of success,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:38:</p>

<p>I guess. Is what what I might call it. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:43:</p>

<p>as someone who often has to tell people in social environments of like, hey, if I start laughing really hard, can you just make sure I don't collapse? Um, I can relate. Um, that has the last few years ever since, you know, cardiac episode after cardiac episode,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:02:</p>

<p>you do start to take a lot of things that other people I guess we take for granted. You, like, treat them as this has been a good day. I haven't blacked out in five days like OK, that is that is like an awesome feeling. All</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:17:</p>

<p>right.</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:17:</p>

<p>So I can I can totally relate</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:21:</p>

<p>to where you're coming from their Well,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:24:</p>

<p>do me a favor, because I know you well, but the people listening to the show probably don't know you as well as ideo. So kind of Introduce yourself. Let people know who you are, what you do and, uh, ultimately like, what brings you joy in the tech space?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:42:</p>

<p>Oh, good gracious. OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:43:</p>

<p>just some smiles, you know?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:45:</p>

<p>Yeah, Just anybody stuff? Um, let's see. I am a python and jingle developer.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:53:</p>

<p>Um, I am self taught. I went to two years of college and then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:01:</p>

<p>didn't go to college after that. Which they still turned you for. Interestingly love? Um, yeah. Uh, wow. Yeah. And spread this whole different thing. But private school is a racket. I don't know why you do that. Um, yes. So I did that I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:20:</p>

<p>and then much later in life, I got into development because it is fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:26:</p>

<p>Um, I started out like my professional life was in fine art photographic printing. So I had about a decade of, ah, life in the art world there, which makes it sound much sexier than it was. Um, although it was fun and good, like, that was a good time. And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:46:</p>

<p>I had my first daughter and kind of rejected out of the job, seen for a while. And when I came back,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:54:</p>

<p>I wanted to do something that, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:57:</p>

<p>compensated for my time in a in a decent way, you know, especially living in San Diego. Um, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:07:</p>

<p>I just thought, you know, I had done I have done some little like apple script scripts. Do you know what this thing is? What? Apples with this? Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:17:</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:17:</p>

<p>get a few of them. Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:20:</p>

<p>usually ones that turn my mic off because I am notorious for, like, ending a conversation being done and then later on, just being like, Oh, the recording still going And then like having three hours of just dead audio toe toe work on?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:36:</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, it's just a little fiddly stuff like that. And so I am. I made some scripts, like, way back</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:45:</p>

<p>many, many years ago. I don't know, 15 years ago or something, And, uh</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:50:</p>

<p>so when I was trying to figure out where am I gonna go now with my career and loves, like, you know, I had fun with that. I'm one,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:59:</p>

<p>you know, making computers do stuff. Like maybe I could do some of that same born, um, and then came, you know, in my learning process came across the python community in San Diego and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:11:</p>

<p>that was it. That's how I am. Kind of got my heat settled.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:17:</p>

<p>So, um, I work in a rightly or really not the car shop, as we were discussing earlier. Um, although I have repaired my car in a variety of ways on my own.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:29:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:31:</p>

<p>it still works. It still runs Most of the things we're still on there. It does have a weird rattle. Um, anyway, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:39:</p>

<p>and my little side projects five up is still</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:44:</p>

<p>up and running.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:46:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:48:</p>

<p>that's me. I have two kids. I'm cat</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:51:</p>

<p>E, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:53:</p>

<p>But I think that's it. The end. Is there more? What else should I say?</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:58:</p>

<p>No, that's it. That's good podcast. No, no, we're gonna look, look, goingto a lot of more detail than that, but but yeah, let's let's start with you know, one of the things that you just brought up was</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:11:</p>

<p>you wanted to do a job that you felt you were being compensated for. I guess I would say as fairly as</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:22:</p>

<p>weird systems that can</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:25:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're not gonna go into that conversation. That's another podcast. But, ah, the big thing was, it wasn't, You know, development wasn't something that you were like.</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:36:</p>

<p>Hey, I'm, like, 14 and hacking in tow. You know, the U S treasury and I've always been a programmer, and like, it wasn't like this whole crazy lifestyle thing for Yeah, I was like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:50:</p>

<p>Here's a small piece of my life that I do that</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:54:</p>

<p>I mean, it be cool if I got paid to do this. I mean, like that. That's a really</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:59:</p>

<p>interesting approach, because it kind of goes against what everybody is taught. You know, when you go to high school, you have to do like, Oh, yeah, you know, you need to go to the best school toe, get into engineering or get into our did to get into all these things. And it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:16:</p>

<p>or you could just live your life, do the things that you enjoy doing and then find something in that realm that actually gives you a paycheck and then do that and then in your free time, make really cool stuff like five up, which we're gonna talk about later. Um, so So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool. Did you find a challenge? Ah, like, did you find it challenging to get into the tech space, Not having the I went toe Caltech or m I t. And you know up. You know, I was born with a keyboard in my hand, like that whole mindset.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:55:</p>

<p>it's tricky because I feel like not having those types of credentials.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:06:</p>

<p>I still like it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:08:</p>

<p>It affects me like it means more to me than it does to other people. You know, I'm</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:16:</p>

<p>I'm grateful. I mean, that's from my experience. Like, I'm grateful that I hade, um, the experience of applying to Riley in working through that process and not</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:31:</p>

<p>not having the pressure to have some sort of pedigree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:36:</p>

<p>in intact.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:39:</p>

<p>So I didn't experience that, But it is always really interesting to talk, Teoh. Other folks that do you have an experience? I was talking to someone the other day who was mentioning that, um, it just so happened that in there, like a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:59:</p>

<p>computer science class that they had,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:03:</p>

<p>they're like senior year in high school, which, first of all, ending a farming town.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:09:</p>

<p>We had f A like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:12:</p>

<p>also way.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:14:</p>

<p>The way that my life shook out. I only I graduated early, surly had, like, one semester of my senior year. And then I went and, like, works in a coffee shop after that, you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:25:</p>

<p>our situations were like small time, different So but he,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:30:</p>

<p>you know, was saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:33:</p>

<p>in my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:34:</p>

<p>in my a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:36:</p>

<p>CS class.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:39:</p>

<p>The teacher happens to know, like the super good friends that someone high up in, you know, X y z tech, like in a huge tech company. And so this BP or whatever from this big tech company comes in and does like, practice interviews with every limits in the class. They're seniors, the high school, they're like 17. You know what I'm saying? Like were 18 or however old they are. They're teenagers, though, for sure. So there's these</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:07:</p>

<p>teenagers. Some of them then got jobs like straight out of high school.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:13:</p>

<p>It's like I was just kind of like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:17:</p>

<p>whoa,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:19:</p>

<p>you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:20:</p>

<p>and I know that, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:24:</p>

<p>you know, you were saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:26:</p>

<p>a second ago like we don't want to get into the whole, like, inequality and what's like, you know, fair compensation and stuff.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:33:</p>

<p>Um, but it is just kind of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:36:</p>

<p>it is kind of mind blowing, right that some people do walk into the tech space saying, you know, I have</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:44:</p>

<p>I have all these credentials. I have all these this experiments, you know, and I'm like one of the computer stuff, but which I did.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:55:</p>

<p>I did have a continuing everyone Yeah, yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:13:01:</p>

<p>I've played Tetris super good at it</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:05:</p>

<p>for me. I always hesitate, you know, toe to talk about kind of the entrance into the tech space, Um, from any level of knowledge, because I technically haven't entered the development space working on it trying really am. But, you know, it is interesting to hear, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:27:</p>

<p>the conversation of</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:30:</p>

<p>you have a perfect example</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:33:</p>

<p>giving a resume to someone or like this, presenting a resume to a company and, like having two people</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:40:</p>

<p>look at your resume and tell you to conflicting things like one is like, Oh, you need to focus on your projects more because you don't have the job experience and one says, Oh, but your other job experience is super relatable for a higher management position, so you should focus on that more, and it's like, Okay, I have one person telling me to put my job experience at the front. The other one told me to put my projects at the front. I can't put them both there like I need writing something. So it it's always interesting to hear the idea of like</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:11:</p>

<p>it can't be this hard</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:13:</p>

<p>for everybody, and it's not necessarily.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:18:</p>

<p>You know, I don't have a solution for that, but I would just I love hearing people address that, like OK, yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:26:</p>

<p>For some people, it was extremely easy for others. It was a little bit harder. And then for some, they're still trying to get their foot in the door. Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:36:</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, I'm glad for some of the people who have</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:41:</p>

<p>gone through whatever they did,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:44:</p>

<p>because now they know what it took, which means they're willing to help other people not have to go through that same thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:52:</p>

<p>Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:53:</p>

<p>And I have to say, like, you know, I worked hard. I tried to learn, I went to conferences and, you know, I built my thing, and I did</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:04:</p>

<p>Those couple of talks like, I put time and energy into it,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:11:</p>

<p>but I knew someone. I honestly think that networking is huge,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:19:</p>

<p>which is also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:23:</p>

<p>just a huge, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:27:</p>

<p>playground for injustice</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:30:</p>

<p>right</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:30:</p>

<p>now</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:32:</p>

<p>because not everybody knows. Well, it I guess the hard part is, is like, if you know someone, you could get a foot in the door. But like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:41:</p>

<p>the people that don't know anyone have a problem And then there's also like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:46:</p>

<p>the We don't want to punish you for bringing in the wrong people kind of feeling that they come that comes with it. Like I I see so many people of color that air in</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:58:</p>

<p>management levels that work with no other people of color. And it's just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:05:</p>

<p>I mean, I'm glad you're not like using it as a way to, like, bring just anybody in. But at the same time, it seems really weird that, like there's not one and it and it's because of that. It's like, Well, if I</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:20:</p>

<p>What if I make a mistake? What if I I have a bad higher and they happen to be a person of color? And then now you're making the problem even worse and even harder for other people in it. It's like again,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:33:</p>

<p>I just wish that it wasn't this hard for everyone and that they didn't have to go to sleep, you know, worrying about their job because they hired someone that they know is capable of doing the work. But because of how they look, you know, it could be a problem. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:46:</p>

<p>ultimately, I don't think that the conversation we're gonna have here is probably gonna solve that problem. But I do hope that someone listening, uh, maybe you can, you know, solve a smaller problem like that and you know your own little world.</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:02:</p>

<p>But you talked about</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:05:</p>

<p>you know, you</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:06:</p>

<p>all the things that you did Do you know, aside from knowing someone like you gave the talks, you built the thing. Like when I first met you,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:17:</p>

<p>I was trying to build a thing</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:19:</p>

<p>and, like, I had no clue what I was doing. And I think, um, a good like, a couple of mutual friends of ours were just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:27:</p>

<p>I mean, this is a cool idea. What are you doing</p>

<p>Melanie 00:17:31:</p>

<p>on? I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:33:</p>

<p>I I had probably I'd probably been using Python for maybe, like, a week and 1/2. So it was like, I have an exact problem. I've solved it in kind of this really ugly way. Now I want to take it to the next step and solve it in a slightly less ugly way. And in doing that, I just kind of screwed it up. But I'm going to talk about your</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:56:</p>

<p>Django app that just brings joy into the world and phones of people. So I'm just gonna I'm going to just sit back and let you just talk about about the app. Talk about the idea for it. Talk about you know what it's been like running it for as long as you've been running. I can't I can't imagine. Like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:16:</p>

<p>I don't think I have anything that's been in the wild for, like, more than a year.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:22:</p>

<p>Yeah. Um, so</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:25:</p>

<p>five opap dot com</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:27:</p>

<p>It's a Django out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:29:</p>

<p>Um, it is not a phone app. I have to say the whole I was just thinking about this today. I think five up dot com was taken. And so I think that's where I went with five. Look after Tom. But to non tech people, like they're like, what's the thing that I download in the night? Just have to say, I'm sorry I made a thing that's confusing. Just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:51:</p>

<p>just ignore that for a second and felt the form and give me all of your personal contact information.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:57:</p>

<p>And then something good is gonna happen. Trust possibly did. Yeah. I mean, I'm a random person on the Internet. Why not? You know. So, um, yes. So what it does is it sends happy texts every day. That's its only function. That's all it does. I got the idea. It's build it because I actually, um the first, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:23:</p>

<p>class that I took on python was through Udacity. And they have this bit in there Where you, um you had to make a little bit of a project using Tulio.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:39:</p>

<p>Um and so I had done, like, I had kind of come up with this idea of, like, isn't that when that be nice to just get happened? Texts</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:48:</p>

<p>And part of the idea between our for sending five texts, which is what it was initially that you could only get five, and that was it. Like you're gonna have a quantity of five. Happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:01:</p>

<p>We're guard lis of what you like. That's what you're getting. Um, but the idea is there's some research that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:11:</p>

<p>maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Whatever. Um, but this concept that need 3 to 5 positive things to outweigh each negatives thing that happens to you. So the idea is like, I'm kind of betting on a negative thing, but you every day. But I mean, if you end up with a surplus of happy. It's fine. It's time</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:36:</p>

<p>not to be upset about it. So eventually I changed it so that you can choose</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:42:</p>

<p>1234 or five per day</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:46:</p>

<p>because people were like, it's too happy</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:48:</p>

<p>saying they were actually just like is like a really, really happy person around you and your like, you're just annoying. Now. I'm sorry. Like I love the people are friendly and something is working well for you, but if you could do it away from me, that would be wonderful. So, um, video just a little bit of happened. Just one.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:08:</p>

<p>yeah, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:11:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:12:</p>

<p>So I came to the Python meet up with this, you know, kind of baby idea, this python script, Um, and then someone was like, oh, built the Django</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:22:</p>

<p>and I was like, all right, you know, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:26:</p>

<p>and then it was just like months of being like I don't know what I'm doing at all and just going home and, like, suffering through, you know, trying to go through this development process and figure it was going on like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:43:</p>

<p>I didn't know it at the time, and I do now. It's kind of both comforting and in infuriating that like hours, hours, and hours, days, weeks of developers time are spent over, like a semi colon in the wrong place. You know, like just a single character, you know, or just this, these the tiniest thing. So, you know, I went two months of that and then eventually got it somewhat working. It was very buggy at first. Um, it is still kind of bugging. Actually Had someone report above a couple weeks ago, and I I almost have it. Thanks, but, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:27:</p>

<p>you know, life, but whatever.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:30:</p>

<p>We need bugs in life, I guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:33:</p>

<p>Yeah. I mean...No.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:36:</p>

<p>no, I got in your gardens</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:40:</p>

<p>right there. Get in the garden. I always try to do that. Things I have young kids, you know where you're like. Let me spine</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:46:</p>

<p>finds him to be grateful for about that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:51:</p>

<p>bugs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:52:</p>

<p>reminds us that we're fallible or something. I</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:57:</p>

<p>Oh, that's that's too funny, though. And I love that, like, again. A lot of the story that came from from this was</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:08:</p>

<p>a level of like, I understand that that life sucks at times.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:13:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:15:</p>

<p>at best I'm I'm leveling the playing field or I guess it. At worst, I'm leveling the playing field That best I'm giving you, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:24:</p>

<p>extra happy. Which to me, that is That is like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:30:</p>

<p>a lot of people know, like my favorite</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:33:</p>

<p>personality in the entire world is the late, great Bob Ross, and it was just like nobody on the planet should ever be. This happy like the guy, like adopt squirrels. It's,</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:48:</p>

<p>I think, of the some of the greatest people that have ever lived. Like Nikola Tesla apparently married a pigeon like there's just a level of coziness that just comes with being</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:01:</p>

<p>an amazing person. And I think that if you could be crazily like happy and just want other people to be justice crazily happy as you like that is the best possible outcome because the</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:18:</p>

<p>the worst</p>

<p>Melanie 00:24:18:</p>

<p>side of that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:19:</p>

<p>like serial killer. So it's like extremely happy sociopath. Serial killer. Where on the spectrum are you and right? So I love that one that you're using your coding skills for good and not sociopathic serial killer. He stuff,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, but also that</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:39:</p>

<p>you pushed through because it was just suggested to you. Um, I am like the exact opposite of that someone tells me to build a jangle after like that. I don't want to build a jingle app. I want to build a flask app. I want a village static site generator like I want to do everything but the thing that everyone is telling me to do because they're telling me to do it this way. And I need to know why I shouldn't do it that 8000 other ways.</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:03:</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:05:</p>

<p>on top of that, you were actually willing to</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:09:</p>

<p>share that experience with the community and not just the app itself. But I've I've had the privilege of listening to what I would consider the greatest python conference talk ever. Um, which is like, so you want to build a jingle app? It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:25:</p>

<p>you. You bring your personality into</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:30:</p>

<p>all the things that you do like. I'm on the 50 website and it's like how it works. Sometimes life has sad things. We have happy messages,</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:38:</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:25:38:</p>

<p>you're not</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:39:</p>

<p>so sad anymore. And it's just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:42:</p>

<p>it doesn't have this weird like s CEO, like marketing spend using 15 different buzzwords for social ranking and like all of this other stuff that people try to do to game the system. It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:57:</p>

<p>it is</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:58:</p>

<p>truly a Melanie Appetite, Melanie website and time. I would be afraid to look at the code because I'm sure the comments would just have me laughing. It's like, This is stupid. I'm not gonna dio because that's what my code looks like. It's like, I hate that I have to</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:15:</p>

<p>do this</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:16:</p>

<p>But apparently Python hates me. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:20:</p>

<p>usually those air like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:22:</p>

<p>I bet my get history</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:24:</p>

<p>my get history is where I hide my secret feelings for sure. Like less often. Yeah, exactly less often in the code itself, I think.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:35:</p>

<p>But Gathers I think there's some some fun. Makes sense Is that there Are you looking girl, your eyes</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:45:</p>

<p>looking for a good one? Execute some lint ing c L. I love it. It's just like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:50:</p>

<p>Oh, see, that's recent. Yeah, that's me. Just do you want stuff cleaning up?</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, that's I probably should do deleted, weird static directory. Stuff like this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:27:03:</p>

<p>is I go. This is</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:04:</p>

<p>the stuff that I think developers need to see on a more regular basis because you get these weird posts or, like, how to write ineffective, get commit messages like I mean, yes, sure, I understand. If someone's reviewing your code, you want to make it as helpful when is clear and concise as possible, but at the same time being able to just get your frustration out a little bit and I get commit?</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:28:</p>

<p>Sure, do it. I think that's absolutely a wonderful way. Teoh, Uh, one not go insane, but to also again inject a little bit of yourself into your work. And, uh, I mean, you've always done that, But please tell everybody about some of the talks you've given about this about well, about the five up app. And also</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:53:</p>

<p>just why just just why? Because the, um I can't even I can't even begin Teoh like breakdown like the talks themselves because they're so good.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:07:</p>

<p>Ah, they really I mean, that's</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:09:</p>

<p>that's not me. Like, you know, trying to butter you up. I genuinely you made me try Django for the first time, literally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:16:</p>

<p>You're talking</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:17:</p>

<p>like OK, I will use Django, but only because Melanie said it's not as bad as it looks.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:24:</p>

<p>It's not as bad as it looks. Um, yeah, So I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:31:</p>

<p>I think I only have the two talks that I ever</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:35:</p>

<p>like, actually gays. I gave them both multiple times, though, um, And then I did also do a, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:44:</p>

<p>like an injured a python that life on a couple years in a row. Um, that waas, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:51:</p>

<p>in short, a python for human people with feelings.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:55:</p>

<p>Um, which was a lot of fun, I think. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:00:</p>

<p>getting in and out on a 25 minute talk is way more manageable for me. Like I think that that's kind of my sweet spot. Three hours of like, having to make sense is pretty tricky.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:13:</p>

<p>Just like I'm so sorry. Everyone, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:29:16:</p>

<p>three hours long,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:18:</p>

<p>red, like in the end, you're just like, I don't know, let's talk about those bugs again or something. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:27:</p>

<p>so, yeah, the first talk that I wrote waas about my experience writing five up and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:34:</p>

<p>all of the things that I did long because some of them were kind of like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:39:</p>

<p>a little bit tragic, you know, like I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:43:</p>

<p>like, recoverable, like I figured it out. But like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:46:</p>

<p>you know, my email and password were like, committed. And to get at some point</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:52:</p>

<p>like that, I agree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:54:</p>

<p>that it's not the best.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:56:</p>

<p>Um And then just like accidentally destroying stuff, it's all these stuff. I mean, I don't know that everyone, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:30:04:</p>

<p>puts their email and password in their code. Like I feel like I kind of win on that one for, like, dumb stuff that you do on accident. Like I'm pretty</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:15:</p>

<p>sure people have done Aziz Muchas They would admit they'd be like, No, I've never done that. I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:21:</p>

<p>Miguel Road, like McGill did a talk about that. I think it pike on a couple of years ago. That's like you accidentally committed your password. Now what do you dio? And to me, that was great because it was saying like, OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:35:</p>

<p>probably one of the most like prominent people to use the plastic framework is telling me that he has screwed up by putting, you know, some type of environment variable that shouldn't be in there or some type of password or some type of authentic r A p I key. That should not have been hard coded in there like he has done this. So when I mean after that talk, I was like, OK, I am team environment, variable for life like</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:02:</p>

<p>the first thing you see is like import os every time because I'm like I will not do that again. I've had that happen to me where someone's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:11:</p>

<p>Yeah, heads up, You should Ah, like I submitted a PR that removed your password for you and I'm like, Oh, thank you for that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:19:</p>

<p>Cool, Great. That's hopeful.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:23:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. So And I think</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:28:</p>

<p>I don't know. I think it's important for people to know like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:32:</p>

<p>there's there's no magic going on here. I mean, people do harder stuff than what Ideo like. I understand that, um, and that people are hearing like super fans and stuff. Andi. But</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:47:</p>

<p>like I'm fancy enough to be employed. So that's something you know and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:53:</p>

<p>and it's not amazing it I mean, like, it's not. It's not so magical and difficult that you can't do it. You know that you can't like you can become a developer and also be a little bit of a bumbling weirdo like these things can be for you. You could be that in one thing. So like, and I I I feel like our fear of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:19:</p>

<p>wow</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:20:</p>

<p>making mistakes</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:22:</p>

<p>and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:24:</p>

<p>being stealing hard,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:26:</p>

<p>keeps us out of spaces where we could really fries. You know, um, and I always imagine that there's someone in the room that is sitting there being like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:37:</p>

<p>Well, I could never you know, because that's me, like, 48</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:43:</p>

<p>100% of the time I was gonna go 48%. But that's a lie. And 4800. It's not really a value that makes any sense, since, though,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:52:</p>

<p>and I have a job, everybody</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:54:</p>

<p>and and the thing with that, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:59:</p>

<p>I I grew up around</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:01:</p>

<p>like the biggest nerd in the world like my grandfather wanted me to be into computers like he let me take apart his computer. He made me put it back together. Um, like I grew up playing with the max, which is probably why I don't use the Mac's in Al.</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:19:</p>

<p>Like I thought one of the first computer games was Eclipse, which is ah, like a job I d</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:28:</p>

<p>on. He was</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:29:</p>

<p>just like, yeah, I just draw stuff in the things and I was like, OK, cool. I'm gonna make a computer game and, like No, no, I didn't. But he knew that I wasn't going to, but he was like Yeah, sure. Try it anyway. And like, this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:40:</p>

<p>is the kind of</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:41:</p>

<p>guy that he went to the university library to doubt, like rent out algebra books for fun. And I'm just like your old man. You're supposed to be, like, watching like, daytime news and sleeping on the couch or something. And I always thought that that's what it meant to be like in the tech space of lying. So you gotta get a like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:06:</p>

<p>if you haven't read every Manning book that's out there, you have it. If you don't have, like, the subscription toe like O'Reilly learning, then you're doing it wrong. You need toe. You need to, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:17:</p>

<p>have submitted, like at least three talks toe every major conference using your language. You need to have been to every talk. Like I hear about all the people that love and fawn over WWDC, and they're like, Oh, it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:33:</p>

<p>the mecca for IOS developers is like, Oh, it's like the mecca for conference viruses. So you probably shouldn't like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:42:</p>

<p>put that stigma on people. Not everyone wants to go to a conference. Everyone is can understand half of what you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:52:</p>

<p>someone who has a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering and has turned that into, like writing functional algorithms using Haskell like not everyone can do.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:05:</p>

<p>Not everyone can understand that. And if</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:07:</p>

<p>you don't, it's okay. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:09:</p>

<p>I think</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:10:</p>

<p>Python, because it's readable, literally showed</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:13:</p>

<p>100 lines of python code that I had written Teoh, a graphic designer, and they were like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:19:</p>

<p>I think you miss. I think there's a space after this comma that's not supposed to be there. And I was like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:24:</p>

<p>How are you debugging my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:29:</p>

<p>like that to</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:30:</p>

<p>me is amazing that people can look at the code, read it and understand what's happening, and that it eliminates the stigma of like you have to have void and no parameters instead of code and and it immediately closes the door on people who are just like, Yeah, I just wanna send five happy tweets. You know, our five happy text to my phone like, Can I do that?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:53:</p>

<p>No. One?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:55:</p>

<p>No, I I love Python. For that reason, I do think like it's one of the more low entry languages out there.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:05:</p>

<p>I've been working with Java script a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and I want to love all languages equally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:19:</p>

<p>I want that so bad.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:21:</p>

<p>Also Pythons the best. I don't know. I don't. I'm sorry, everyone. I just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:28:</p>

<p>It's just clean ends.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:32:</p>

<p>I don't know. It's it's low entry. I think, Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:37:</p>

<p>yeah, it's good stuff, but what you were saying, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:42:</p>

<p>a second ago about</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:44:</p>

<p>this huge range of like one</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:48:</p>

<p>you know, one engineer has a PhD in is doing this grace and stuff, you know, down to like, here's me,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:56:</p>

<p>you know, making my little Web app. That doesn't silly and nice thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:01:</p>

<p>Um, that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:03:</p>

<p>that gap</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:06:</p>

<p>was really difficult and overwhelming to experience at my first pie con, Um, because it's, you know what, like 3500 people or something. And you do have these people that have their doctorates and, you know, like listening to some of the talks. I remember because I was, you know, obviously much newer to Python at the time. Um, but I remember just being like I'm not doing,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:35:</p>

<p>you know, like we'd go into a room and there's like, Here's a 20 minute talk</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:40:</p>

<p>and, like I know they said words and there were slides like there were visuals, so a lot of stuff happening there. And yet</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:48:</p>

<p>I have no idea what just happened.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:52:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:54:</p>

<p>no, you know, And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:57:</p>

<p>the,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:58:</p>

<p>you know, kind of the little circles of people that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:02:</p>

<p>then joined up in our like, you know, what do you dio And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:06:</p>

<p>you know, like, I do fancy things, You know? I'm like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:11:</p>

<p>Hyson tweets the tell you your sparkling mermaid, not tweets and text messages, You know, actual message by the way you mentioned earlier. Bob Ross. Do you know that? I quote Bob Breast in private.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:24:</p>

<p>I didn't. And now</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:27:</p>

<p>I I don't get text messages. City</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I probably drug simple.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:32:</p>

<p>No, it's not you. It's I go, Yeah, I did this thing where it was like, don't ever get a message or like, a phone call from anyone that's on your favorites. And ever since then, people like chaos and your message lychee After you did</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:49:</p>

<p>e don't get half my messages anymore, which is great, cause I have plausible deniability. Anytime I don't want to do something like I didn't get the message. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's awesome.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:59:</p>

<p>I mean, you broke up with me, and I just found out</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:03:</p>

<p>and we literally had a like It's not years me moments that happened</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:10:</p>

<p>that's gonna be on the Internet now is fine. Oh, man.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:14:</p>

<p>Science. My received text that I send myself. That's what I going to dio like self wish that I do. Now</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:23:</p>

<p>I'm gonna do the horrible thing you should never do after a breakup. I'm just gonna keep going forward.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:28:</p>

<p>Thank</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:32:</p>

<p>you. Talked about, like, just kind of the vast difference of conversations that air had it conferences.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:42:</p>

<p>I gave my first conference talk at North Bay Python last year and, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:50:</p>

<p>I couldn't go. So a conference, it</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:53:</p>

<p>really isn't there not having won this year, which I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:57:</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:58:</p>

<p>they announced it last year that they were having won. I felt like I felt like they</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:02:</p>

<p>feel like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:02:</p>

<p>Josh knew he was just like, something's gonna happen. He's like, we don't want to be a part of it. We're out this year will see on two years. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:12:</p>

<p>one of the talks, that was it was like the second I was the last talk in the first half. And then the next talk after me was Greedo. And he was talking about writing. He was</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:25:</p>

<p>talking about writing</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:25:</p>

<p>a peg par surfer python. And I'm just like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:29:</p>

<p>I don't know what</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:30:</p>

<p>you're talking about. I'm gonna look, and I'm just gonna be like, Okay, Yeah, sure, whatever. And then we all got dinner together and it was me,</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:41:</p>

<p>you know, And then, like a couple of other developers that are like python core maintainers and I'm just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:48:</p>

<p>and luckily, my talk was mostly about podcasting, So I felt like I knew what I was talking about, but they were all like, Ah, yes. So I would really love to learn how like podcasting could be implemented, you know, in a larger</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:04:</p>

<p>audience in the python community. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I would love to learn more about whatever it is you talked about earlier to Andi. That's like, That's the crazy feeling that when we create this facade that, like, you have to have a PhD, you have to be, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:23:</p>

<p>a huge brainiac to write code that matters. What you're doing is you're taking your skill set away from the people that could genuinely benefit from the things that you can bring to the table like has a podcaster I know way more than any human should about dealing with transcriptions with AWS and</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:47:</p>

<p>having these talks with mentors where it's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:51:</p>

<p>Hey, I built a framework that does like it creates a</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:55:</p>

<p>standard schema for transcription. So matter what Web service you're using, whatever developable law. And they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:02:</p>

<p>why? I was like because you told me I needed a project that would make me hire Well, that's why. And they're like But why that when I was like, Well, it's because it's a thing that I have to deal with on a regular basis. So and as we're breaking it down and like talking about it, they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:18:</p>

<p>Wait,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:20:</p>

<p>what you built this I'm like, Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but like, you know, this is like, this is stuff that you would give, like a keynote talk on, like the whole process of building this stuff. And it's like I just had a problem that I need to solve. So I solved it. And then I realized that there was a bigger problem, so I started working on solving that, too, and they're like, Yeah, that's what developers do. Congratulations and I'm like, Well, okay, I still need a job</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:50:</p>

<p>like no one's gonna take me serious If I'm just the guy that comes up and goes, Hey, I do podcasting. Come on, let's talk about Python. Um, it and that's where it's It's so frustrating because it's like, How do we fix that? And I've literally had people telling me like</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:06:</p>

<p>you would give really good talks it, like the local conference seen and I'm like, What the hell does that mean? And they're like, Well, you know, some talks were made for conferences that have less than, like 1000 people and then some. Some talks were made for people that are not for people, but for conferences that have, like there, like Pike on Level. And I'm like, Okay, that's stupid. Like I feel like my should be good</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:30:</p>

<p>one of</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:30:</p>

<p>the people</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:33:</p>

<p>that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:35:</p>

<p>that's frustrating. That's a frustrating thing that you just described that someone said, like also, I'm gonna go and say That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:46:</p>

<p>so. And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:50:</p>

<p>because a at Piper on not every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:55:</p>

<p>talk is Aquino.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:58:</p>

<p>Just just in case anyone hasn't been before, there's either. There's a handful of key notes, but when you pulled off. All the majority of the stocks are in a small room, you know. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:11:</p>

<p>talk it, Pike. On talking a local conference like you could end up with the same number of people like ends. You know, Northway Python. It's single track. So instead of you know, at high Con, where you have seven different walks, you could go to it and given time slot,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:27:</p>

<p>you know, Northway Python. There's one you're gonna end up with it a pack grim.</p>

<p>Jay 00:44:32:</p>

<p>Everybody at that conference paid to hear you talk.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. It's wonderful. So there's that element. But also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:43:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:44:</p>

<p>I feel like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:49:</p>

<p>you never know why</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:51:</p>

<p>your talk gets turned away from any particular conference. You know, it could be that they got</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:58:</p>

<p>a bunch of different talks on that same topic. Like it just so happens to be that way, you know? I mean, unless is it are you doing close like sleight of hand magic? Is that because I can see I can say that being like meeting a small room</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:15:</p>

<p>for this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:15:</p>

<p>presentation, a volunteer</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:19:</p>

<p>and need a volunteer, and everyone has to be within arm's length of my body</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:24:</p>

<p>so and I don't know. I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:29:</p>

<p>I think in general, in life,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:32:</p>

<p>none of us know we're doing like, ever. So when people sit down and they're like, Well, this thing is good for this circumstance, Like, you know, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:43:</p>

<p>none of us know what we're doing. Just admit it and go on, like with any of the stuff we're doing. We're lucky that we still exist as a species.</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:57:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And I want in this on a way more positive. Note that wherever you are now, So please tell me what's what's next for five up. Is there anything next for five up? Is it just gonna be more of the same? And I'm okay with that, too, cause I'm happy with it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:15:</p>

<p>Um well, first is fixing the very important broken thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:22:</p>

<p>This so that that's sexy updates coming at you fast. Um, but there are There are some things that I've wanted to dio um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:32:</p>

<p>So there's a database that I curate of messages that go out, but you've been also every user has a personal needs, so I can send you my link, and you can put a nice message into my cue and I'll get that mixed in with the other curated ones. Um, and that's like actually a really, really fun and powerful</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:52:</p>

<p>um, feature. What I want to do with that is make it so that you can see your past messages like your past custom ones and break you them, because right now you get it once and you never see it again. So I don't want to reveal them before you get thm. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:12:</p>

<p>because the surprise is important.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:14:</p>

<p>We like surprised, like delight is in surprise. Unless it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:20:</p>

<p>surprise your bankrupt like That's not awesome. But like surprise. I think you're a cool person. Is like is nice, you know, So I don't want to reveal them before you see them, But it's</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:31:</p>

<p>some of the custom messages that I've received, and I know that other people have received have been really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:41:</p>

<p>like they can hold you up, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:44:</p>

<p>um and so if you have the option to go back and say, like, actually, just keep that in my queue all the time, you know some that's me, every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:51:</p>

<p>Howard along. That's that's one thing that I've been wanting to dio, um, I want to make it some people can suggest</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:59:</p>

<p>things for the general database. And then I can</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:02:</p>

<p>say that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:03:</p>

<p>you know, I can allow them to go in because the it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:08:</p>

<p>350 messages or so that are in there. But they're all ones that I've stood in. You know that I signed and thinker interesting have been there but would be nice to have other people. You know, we have a lot of men, but then it's You do have lots and Jay Peak America's like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:24:</p>

<p>Yeah, some people have weird,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:27:</p>

<p>weird heroes out there. This is So, um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:32:</p>

<p>you think those air</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:35:</p>

<p>I I have been wanting to, like, make it a tweet pot or so, but that's like latter. Now I would love to be able to send pictures. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:45:</p>

<p>but that's kind of it's all kind of tricky because it's this weird like, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:51:</p>

<p>sent through like it sent by email to the SMTP gateway for each of the carriers, you know, for a long period. So there's a little bit of tricking us involved there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:04:</p>

<p>You mentioned using Tulio earlier, and we're definitely not gonna get too deep into the weeds here, But the</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:12:</p>

<p>Tulio a p I has that like SMS thing?</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:18:</p>

<p>Is that utilizing the same like email stuff? Or is that actually using, like a phone number type</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:25:</p>

<p>whatever.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:29:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:30:</p>

<p>abandoned twilio straightaway because it's very expensive. Um, especially if you get any number of users that are getting five messages a day legs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:43:</p>

<p>I can't afford that is quite expensive. And so but send bread,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:48:</p>

<p>um, was very affordable. And so I had to kind of do this hack around to figure out how to use the S and P gateways to send The message is so like each carrier has like, a phone number at</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:01:</p>

<p>something at 18 c commune over something like this. So you email the</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:07:</p>

<p>that email address, then it comes through a text.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:11:</p>

<p>So that's what I did. And then, interestingly enough, uh, Tulio then acquired sin bread and ensure</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:19:</p>

<p>they have not jacked up saying grits, Princes, is this I know. Or maybe I've like, you know, I just got in at the right time, But, um, when I saw that, I was like, Please don't touch me more money. I do this for fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:33:</p>

<p>I want people to be happy. But like, not like many, many hundreds of dollars are happy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:39:</p>

<p>All of my users air happy. I am miserable because I got a 48th of happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:44:</p>

<p>Yeah, I can do that. I can't do that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:47:</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:49:</p>

<p>yeah, that's how that works.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:50:</p>

<p>And five up is free, right?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>One of his act. Yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:57:</p>

<p>Uh, though message and data rates may apply. I just saw that at the bottom.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:02:</p>

<p>Yeah, I did that stuff that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:06:</p>

<p>doesn't say like expensive messages are not happy. I'm pretty sure I shove blood in there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:11:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:12:</p>

<p>Lissy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:13:</p>

<p>Yes? Make sure you know about your texting and data plan. Expensive messages are not happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:19:</p>

<p>They're not. I mean, I have a good database of messages, but, like, I don't know if they cost you 1/4. No, e, I don't know. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:29:</p>

<p>Oh, man, that's too good. All right, well, let's let's get ready to button this up, cause we seven after show to get Teoh. Um, let everybody know once again, if they want to talk to you or if they want to learn more about five up, um, Or if they wanna check out any of your amazing conference talks, where can they do all of those things.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:52:</p>

<p>Let's see. So five up is five a pap dot com.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:58:</p>

<p>Um, I am on Twitter and, like, everywhere on the Internet almost is. Hello, Melanie C. Um, so twitters where I hang out the most, um, Facebook and I are on a break.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:11:</p>

<p>Eso don't look for me there. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:15:</p>

<p>see what else?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:18:</p>

<p>Five apps on Twitter. I think it's high by Bob the terrible</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:22:</p>

<p>project, Mom,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:24:</p>

<p>it's on there somewhere. You'll find it just 11.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:27:</p>

<p>Some branding thing will figure that out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, and then all of my talk, sir, on YouTube. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:35:</p>

<p>if you want, you can keep them all up and compare each, you know, performance to the next and rate them and send it to me. And I'll get real sad about it. Never beautiful.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:47:</p>

<p>I would recommend the ah, the North Bay Python talk.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:51:</p>

<p>Um, about how to get started. To Jingo, it was very, very funny. I heard multiple people, not just me say that it was the best talk of the entire conference, so Oh, yeah. You could definitely got that award.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:08:</p>

<p>yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:09:</p>

<p>it was It was a fun one. It was fun. Everything went wrong. Little preview furry you people out there the panic that you see Israel. It was not staged.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:19:</p>

<p>Oh, I remember that. It was Yeah, that was</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:24:</p>

<p>I think I triple prepared for my talk. Because of that, I was just like, I know it works. I know everything is good. I'm just going to do it again just to make sure. And also that was their first year doing a conference. So I'm sure, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:40:</p>

<p>the first year versus the third year, though, should they got a lot of bugs? You know, it</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:45:</p>

<p>wasn't them. It wasn't them. It was me. And I swear to you, I had practiced that talk so many times. And the things that went wrong that you saw had never gone wrong before. Like had not gone run 30 minutes prior. When that happens, been in the green room. It was just, you know, the stars just aligns to really make me vulnerable and sweaty, very sweaty.</p>

<title>Frontmatter replacing custom parser in Render Engine</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>There's a tug-of-war in software development around whether or not your products
should be dependent light or heavy. Render Engine has always taken the stance of
in order to make the best possible service with my limited availability for
maintenance, I have to rely on folks how are putting energy into components. One
area that I did implement myself was a custom parser that allowed you to add all
the metadata for your page objects in the file themselves. This was to replicate
what static generators like Pelican and and Jekyl were doing to make migrating
to Render Engine feel simpler.</p>

<p>Recently, friend and mad-yogi of the internet, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> added support for a framework called Frontmatter to his
application bunch. This greatly enhanced the applications ability to customize
how and when bunches triggered and increased his ability to add other features
to the app.</p>

<p>After that friend and mentor, <a href="https://twitter.com/webology">Jeff Triplett</a> showed me how he was
using python-frontmatter along with PyDantic to help build some custom sites to
support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Well, that was enough to
encourage me to give it a try.</p>

<p>It's not ready yet. There is a bunch of planning that is still needed to make it stable and to provide an easy conversion path,
but <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/render_engine">in testing</a> I have built
initial support for frontmatter in Render Engine.</p>

<p>IT'S NOT TESTED, IT WILL REWRITE YOUR CONTENT TO FIT THAT FORMAT. There will be updates in the future so
keep an eye out.</p>

<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 28 Dec 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a smaller TIFOTIR. I've been spending a lot of time in the last few weeks on vacation playing with my kiddo this holiday season. </p>

<p>There were still a few things I've been doing more with Still</p>

<h2><a href="https://anchor.fm/sia-sarvaiya">the phobias podcast</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/anchor-generated-image-bank/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo400/9576437/9576437-1603090521699-2ca8fedcc2d0a.jpg" alt="phobias podcast" /></p>

<p>I am always looking for new podcasts to get into. Sia is creating a podcast that looks at a number of phobias (one per episode).</p>

<p>I don't believe that I have any phobias (None that are crippling that is), but it's interesting to learn about the things that have an impact on those around me.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Drawfee">Drawfee</a> (YouTube)</h2>

<p><img src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjppzfOBvPH31BtYXrwaGYkYfq1PZjTp8hcJCTo0Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj" alt="drawfee logo" /></p>

<p>This has become the night-time cool down video channel for my wife and I. This came from <em>College Dropout</em> and are now independent. The team draws concepts from their community. They are often mashups of games, popular culture and other things.</p>

<p>I like watching Drawfee because it's fun and funny. Their drawing is great but it's not hyper realistic. It's people that love drawing that are now doing this for a living and making a ton of people laugh.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CityPlannerPlaysCityBuilders">City Planner Plays City Builder</a> (YouTube)</h2>

<p><img src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni2PFVSvLUj8KSZOKUQRu4ImJ3Y-Hc45_bC7f29=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj" alt="City Planner Plays City Builders" /></p>

<p>Another industry I know nothing about and would have no idea how to learn about is city planning. Other than Sim City and some attention stealing iOS games, I've never had to plan a city.</p>

<p><em>City Planner Plays City Builders</em> is what it says it is. It's informational. The creator has to make decisions that go against their judgement and knowledge in order to make the best of the environment and budget they are given. They also get to take their knowledge and push the game to create some amazing city scapes and patterns that I would never be able to build. I encourage you to take a look.</p>

<title>Multipotentiality vs Mindfulness</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Having many friends that are into personal productivity<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, I've come to learn about several <em>lifestyle</em> schools of thought. Many people devote to the GTD way of life, while others, like myself, have decided to reduce the number of technological dependencies in favor of a more analog lifestyle.</p>

<h2>The Mindfulness Movement</h2>

<p>Mindfulness is a growing trend in personal productivity. Many productivity YouTubers present a very worry-free lifestyle that talks about mastering languages and giving themselves personal challenges to make the question habits and vices. The success of the genre itself speaks to the power of and intrigue from others that comes from the idea that you can live a life that above all things centers on understanding and challenging the things that you are doing at any given time.</p>

<h2>What is a Multipotentialite?</h2>

<p>Renown author and speaker on the subject, Emilie Wapnik defines on <a href="https://puttylike.com/terminology/">her site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.</p>
  
  <p>It stems from the word "multipotentiality" – a psychological and educational term used to describe people who display aptitudes across multiple disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put, it's not just about doing a lot, but it's doing a lot with a higher degree of skill in each venture.</p>

<p>I've defined myself as a <em>multipotentialite</em> for the last 3 years. My passions are in podcasting, development, and community engagement.</p>

<h2>Can These Worlds Collide and <em>Should</em> They?</h2>

<p>Having defined these two areas, I begin to wonder if it is possible to even claim to both live a life that challenges each action and embrace the chaos and unique challenges of weaving in and out of passions.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/creative-female-artist-with-painted-vase-in-modern-studio-3817583.jpg" alt="person holding skulpture" /></p>

<p>The more important question, in my opinion, is not if we can, but more if we should?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>My answer to this challenge would be "to a certain degree". I do believe that there is value in uncertainty and rigidity is often the enemy of creativity<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">3</a></sup>. But I also think there is something to gain from strategically putting yourself in a position to let your creativity flourish.</p>

<h2>Making Room for Your Hats</h2>

<p>This topic of thought probably belongs in a blog post called "Multipotentiality vs Minimalism" which is something that I considered writing and but I'm not the most versed on minimalism (by choice), so I don't feel comfortable speaking on it with any level of expertise.</p>

<p>One of the biggest areas of <em>Mindfulness</em> is questioning the value and ultimately choosing to not do something. When you are a multipotentialite, you often tend to naturally collect a lot of things, as you are doing more. To make room, you may need to remove a few things both physically and mentally. </p>

<p>Our interests change over time. A multipotentialite's superpower is the ability to push their passions (however many there are) as far as possible given their constraints. By removing many of the constraints we maximize the time and energy that we can devote to the things that matter to us.</p>

<p>In some ways, this can be changing your job to one that better aligns with your current fascinations, or dialing back the amount of time we spend on one, less meaningful hobby to focus more time and energy on more impactful endeavors.</p>

<p>On the physical side, I can keep this one brief. By removing the things that aren't as important to you, you now can showcase the more valuable things. That's it. That's the tweet.</p>

<h2>Thinking about How to Live Your Best MultiPotential Life</h2>

<p>Part of the Mindfulness mentality that often gets ignored is the idea of choosing the things that you will do.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/photo-of-a-woman-thinking-941555.jpg" alt="Person with computer with paints in foreground" /></p>

<p>There is a subset of <em>multipods</em>, that aren't doing many different things <strong>at once</strong>. Many people don't consider themselves multipotentialites because they hung up their ice skates, electric guitar, and sculpting tools long ago. For many embracing the lifestyle, they can create new opportunities in old passions by finding new ways to participate. Today there are new mediums to engage in a passion and countless possibilities to work in and around an industry.</p>

<p>For me, this means connecting with developers on Twitter and inviting them onto the [Productivity in Tech Podcast] to learn more about the awesome things they are doing (Podcasting and Community Engagement). When I hear of something new, I play around with it on my stream. Often they ask me about podcasting and live-streaming and that leads to doing consultancy and editing work. Then to help reduce the amount of work that I'm doing at any time, I create tools to help those same creators.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the heart of multipotentiality, there is a need for flexibility. At the heart of mindfulness, there is a need for a lack of rigidity. 🤔 It seems like the core fundamentals of these two ways of living are the same.</p>

<title>Don&#39;t Ban Companies, Change the Rules</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The allegations of abuse from Tik Tok and WeChat stem from features that data made accessible by other app developers. These Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing third-party access to friend data</li>
<li>Allowing connection between users in support requests</li>
<li>Providing device and network tracking information</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes me upset that these companies are playing by the rules but getting punished for it.</p>

<p>Like Tim Cook told Congress at the latest hearing. "If you don't like how we're doing things, change the rules."</p>

<p>I look forward to the investigation that will show that there are companies all over the world that are doing the same thing with the data that Facebook and other social media companies with "Login With..." functionality.</p>

<h2>My Suggested Action</h2>

<p><strong>Make it illegal for companies to sell your data to third-parties</strong></p>

<p>I understand that network and location-based data is pushing current app innovation. It allows for things like Uber and Yelp to work. I do think that this information should not be available outside of the company.</p>

<h2>Why Won't They Do This?</h2>

<p>This will make it possible to surface ads based on information without selling that information.</p>

<p>It also creates a level of protection from our government<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Our information would only pass to surveillance organizations from companies with a court order.</p>

<p><strong>That is why this would never happen.</strong> </p>

<p>Governments are trying to pass laws forcing backdoors into their encryption. No government wants to give up the right to spy on folks. </p>

<p>In Short, America wants to spy on you. They just don't want others to do the same. 🙃</p>

<title>Popclip Extension Snippets</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Popclip announced a new update that made making snippets much easier.</p>

<p>I took some time to make a couple videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/i4ORaFxbHvg">the first one</a> about the update and shows a pretty simple use case using my project <a href="https://diversityorgs.tech">https://diversityorgs.tech</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF8KHV7s3EE">second video</a> showing that even though they made making snippets easier, you can still do a lot if you know a little scripting.</p>

<p>Also I create a repo of snippets in this <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Jays-PopClip-Snippets">GH repo</a>.</p>

<title>asdf, direnv and the upgrade to python 3.10</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/249/all-of-linux-as-a-python-api">Python Bytes</a> a post mentioned using <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/" title="Home - asdf">asdf</a> and direnv to manage Python versions.</p>

<p>I've always looked for a good way to have auto-setting environments and while <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> did a lot for that. I feel like using pyenv via Homebrew was a step backward, having to initialize <code>pyenv-virtualenvwrapper</code> every time I opened the terminal felt like I was doing something wrong. <em>I probably was</em>.</p>

<p>That said asdf gives you pyenv-like<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> simplicity for running multiple versions of Python (and nvm, and ruby, and other things).</p>

<h2>My Installation</h2>

<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>

<p><strong>Install <a href="https://brew.sh/" title="The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux) — Homebrew">Homebrew</a></strong>. We aren't removing it from our setup, just liberating it from programming language version management responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Install <a href="https://direnv.net/" title="direnv – unclutter your .profile - direnv">direnv</a></strong>. Using the <code>layout</code> command is how we'll create that auto-environment control. layout will create a <em>shim</em> of our requested Python version in the <code>.direnv</code> directory of our project<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>[Optional]</strong> - This blog post is using <a href="https://www.zsh.org/" title="Zsh">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" title="Oh My Zsh - a delightful &amp; open source framework for Zsh">ohmyzsh</a> as the environment. It's not required but this post will explain the setup using that.</p>

<h2>Install asdf and Python</h2>

<p>Run <code>brew install asdf</code>. If running ohmyzsh, you can add asdf to the list of plugins, otherwise be sure to follow any setup instructions.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/python_3_10_asdf_errors_omz_plugins.png" alt="zsh plugins" />.</p>

<p>You'll also need the <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python" title="GitHub - danhper/asdf-python">asdf-python plugin</a> with <code>asdf plugin-add python</code></p>

<p>Next you'll need to install Python through asdf. I recommend completely <a href="https://dev.to/therealdarkmage/clean-up-and-remove-a-python3-homebrew-install-21ai">uninstalling Python via Homebrew</a>. Once that is done you can re-install Python using the command <code>asdf install python &lt;PYTHON VERSION&gt;</code> you can also use <code>latest</code> for the Python version if you aren't sure with version is the latest one.</p>

<p>You can verify the python versions installed using <code>asdf list python</code>. You can verify that asdf installed version of python is default by running <code>which python</code>.</p>

<p>If you have multiple versions installed, you can select the version similar to <code>pyenv</code> using <code>asdf global python &lt;PYTHON VERSION&gt;</code></p>

<p>You can tell which one is set using <code>python --version</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/python_3_10_asdf_errors_python_versions.png" alt="asdf python versions" /></p>

<h2>Register a Python Environment for Your Project</h2>

<p>When you want to create a new project make the directory for that project. Then create a .envrc file and add <code>layout python &lt;PYTHON VERSION&gt;</code></p>

<p>I had a recent issue with the <PYTHON VERSION> part of this<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. If you drop this then it will use the latest version by default.</p>

<p>Then you will need to activate direnv using <code>direnv allow</code>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>If I remember correctly it's actually using pyenv to manage the version. I'm too lazy to check.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-2">
<p>Also thanks to <a href="https://jefftriplett.com">Jeff Triplett</a> who got me into direnv for directory based environment variables a while ago.&#160;<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-3">
<p>To be fair, at the time of writing the version I was trying to use was less than 24 hours old so things may not have been updated yet. I just tried again before releasing this and the problem has been fixed.&#160;<a href="#fnref-3" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the Quarantine, I've been goign on two weekly walks with a couple of PIT
Premium Members.</p>

<p>This allows me to do a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Catch up/Learn more with members of my community</li>
<li>Get some exercise</li>
<li>Vent about whatever it is I need to vent about.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been struggling to keep weight off as my asthma has been worsening with
the weight gain. If my friends are not available, I tend to take this route
with my headphones in and use the time to decompress or just think about
things. Also the time away from my computer really helps.</p>

</ul><p><strong>Tales from the Tavern - Mr. Hlywd</strong></p>That Battlemaster is the largest minion I've made yet. I drew and played him early with decent stats. I mean, 20 health is 20 health. Next I drew Bran and immediately began scheming my glorious victory plan. Like they say, teamwork makes the scheme work. Drawing a 2nd Battlemaster my palms began to sweat as I raced flawed animation times, frantically trying to cycle minions to create space. WHY DOESN'T CLICKING JUST CANCEL THE ANIMATIONS!?!? There, nailed it. First try. My two Battlemasters, the second a Brann-empowered 3 times larger than the first, stood as a testament to my cunning skill &amp; flawless game play. Then, unexpectedly, RNG'sus himself appeared before me. Lifting me through the air he announced loudly,"Behold! For he who believeth in the triune minion, the almighty Battlemaster and the holy Brann, he shall not want!" and the third and final Battlemaster appeared, swirling together with the previous two, combining stats &amp; shimmering with gold. Slamming it back down on the board with only seconds to spare I watched in awe as Bran worked his magic on the shiny demon, culminating in the monstrous behemoth seen before you. It was the single greatest experience of my Hearthstone Battlegrounds career, preceded immediately by the single worst experience as I watched in horror and disgust, the 1/1 divine shield poisonous merloc casually remove my creation with an unassuming "mrrgll".<p><strong><br />Closing Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Shoutouts:<ul>

<title>My Life is a Tetris Board</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Your friend ADHD Tech Worker here to admit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I may I'm addicted to work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When was the last time you tried to not think about things for a bit? I don't mean playing meditation music and trying to relax.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm referring to the idea of saying I have enough going on right now and I don't want to put more on myself. I'm often neglecting projects because I have other projects waiting. I'm almost always thinking, "I need to do something to prepare for this so I will sit these other things down to focus on this thing over here".</p>

<p>As I'm writing this. I can think of several things that I need to do instead. Here's a sample:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record the Audio/Video for the PIT Show</li>
<li>Clean up the code around my blog</li>
<li>Do some work on <em>Transcriptor</em></li>
<li>Do some work on <em>Render Engine</em></li>
<li>Do some work on <a href="https://diversityorgs.tech">diversityorgs.tech</a></li>
<li>Do some work on <a href="https://writeuglycode.com">writeuglycode.com</a></li>
<li>Edit and finish another blog post</li>
<li>Clean my bedroom</li>
</ul>

<p>But instead I'm writing you. </p>

<p>Sure finish this, I may open my notebook or a digital project manager and think about the best way to tackle any of these projects. Or I'll play Tetris. Tetris seems to have the same level of brain activity (or work) with less of the stakes. In fact my life is analogous to a game of Tetris where I'm constantly trying to spin activities and place them strategically in my life until I either fill the board (burn out) or complete a line (project) and open a little more space for the next batch of shapes. </p>

<p>Of the next piece is coming. I should probably do something with it.</p>

<title>Elasticsearch Pinboard Script (Python)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this <a href="/my-new-job-and-what-that-means-for-all-the-things-i-do">new gig</a>, I'm hoping to learn how to help those that are using the <a href="/elastic-0">Elastic Stack</a>, especially in Python. In a recent conversation with internet's mad scientist, <a href="https://brettterpstra.net">Brett Terpstra</a>. We were talking about <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/slogger/">Slogger</a>, his retired application that he used to log his life activity into Day One. This project was eventually removed as the API for Day One changed.</p>

<p>This is something I've always enjoyed about Brett. He solves his quirky problems for him.</p>

<p>There are a few applications that are overkill or a little too creepy (exist.io) for my needs, but I did like the idea of getting an idea of "how I compute". I mean this by how I spend my time producing and collecting on the internet. One of the things that I do is collect all my twitter posts and likes and retweets in pinboard. I thought it would be great to use Pinboard's API to log and manage my own data and analyze it using the Elastic Stack. So I decided to build a <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-pinboard">script</a> that allows me (and you if you wanna) to visualize my information.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/CleanShot_2020-10-21_at_18.40.49_2x_q7UEnmTnf.png" alt="Word Cloud" /></p>

<p>As with most of my projects I have built this in Python and it's not a commercial tool, but it is open-source and available for you to build and hack away on. </p>

<p>I hope you'll check it out - <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-pinboard">https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-pinboard</a></p>

<title>Health Check-in</title>  <description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/e6a4a28c"></iframe>

<p>Here's an update on my health.  It's short because I'm sleepy I may update more later.</p>

<h2>Physical Health</h2>

<p>Pre-Diabetic!? ME!? OH NO....</p>

<p>On a diet (sips Pepsi), it's going as good as 2020 could make it. (No excuses I have been counting calories and trying to change my habits).</p>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>

<p>Finally going to therapy. Only had one session so don't know anything yet.</p>

<h2>Professional Health</h2>

<p>Work's good. I'm challenging myself and pushing our team to do new things. They like it. I like it sweet!</p>

<title>Announcing Transcriptor</title>  <description><![CDATA[<h2>This was the launch month for [Transcriptor]. This is a helper package that I use for doing transcriptions for PIT Clients.</h2>

<p>Transcriptions can be accomplished in a plethora of ways, but in order to do it, you need to have a good idea of how to work with the results from your transcription engine. While I usually use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a>, I have used <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/">Google Could Services Speech to Text</a> and I would love to look into the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.Ai</a>. All of these systems use their own schema for your task and your results.</p>

<p>The goal of transcriptor is to create a single Job object that is responsible (currently) for handling the results in a consistent object-oriented way. By using it, I've been able to create some clarity in my coding projects for folks and reduced the amount of copying and pasting across the board.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Can you use it?</em> <strong>At your own risk, sure.</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it documented?</em> <strong>Not Yet</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it stable?</em> <strong>I wouldn't say that...</strong></li>
<li><em>Is it open source?</em> <strong>Of course it is!</strong></li>
<li><em>Am I accepting contributions</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>I am accepting testing and documentation PRs, I'm also looking at incoming issues and If you have a fix (Not a Feature Request), I will accept after testing and reviews.</p>

<title>I Was Selected as a Mentee for the First Podcast Mentorship Cohort</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a firm believer that it is incredibly hard to be a <em>self taught</em> anything.</p>

<p>In fact one of the <strong>easiest</strong> ways to learn is sharing and learning from others.</p>

<p>That's why I'm happy to announce I'll be doing just that as a member of the
first cohort of the <a href="https://www.podcastmentorship.net">Podcast Mentorship Program</a>), imagined by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">Myke
Hurley</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/analogue/178">Analog(ue)</a> Myke
announced he was launching a mentorship program. I was hesitant to sign up as
I've been podcasting for about 5 years now.</p>

<p>Here's something that I recently came to terms with thanks to a great
conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieyo">Brian Douglas</a>. </p>

<h3>You need to let people help you.</h3>

<p>Myke has a decade of experience in podcasting. Many of the people that I
interview on the show have been doing what they are doing professionally for
many years and have the experience of that journey to help them grow.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/671c723f">interview with Tom Merritt</a>, he
covers a secret to his success as a community builder and podcaster. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at CNet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could all follow the steps of Tom here and get a string of jobs where you learn from
years of experience or we can learn from their years of experience and shave
off incredible amounts of time.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning with and from all of the amazing people (all who are at
different places in their career).</p>

<p>Check out each of the members and their projects.

<title>Fresh Builds Daily</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges faced with faced with static site generation is not having to be on top of things. When <a href="!g conduit relay.fm">Conduit</a> releases, if I would like my website to update, this would require me to run a script to rebuild my site<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Yesterday I took a look at my GitHub action for triggering [render engine] to run. I was surprised to see a handful of issues that had been keeping it from running as expected for almost a year!</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/GH%20Action%2012%20months%20inactive.png" alt="This didn't run for 12 months" /></p>

<p>After fixing what was out dated code, I added the <code>cron</code> build step to my Github action.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> <span class="n">schedule</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">cron</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0 8,12,16,20 * * *&quot;</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gave me the ability to run my script 4x each day. Also after fixing an issue with my folder not overwriting (still not sure as to why but this <a href="https://github.com/JesseTG/rm">Remove Folder</a> action did solve the issue) this mean that I would have a clean build of my site every four hours, fixing a duplication issue that I'm still unsure of why it's happening.</p>

<p>I'm not happy that I have some bugs that aren't solved but I am happy that I have a nice little fix to make sure that my site is always within 4 hours of being up to day with what I'm doing.</p>

<title>Getting text from websites using Keyboard Maestro</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/how-to-automate-form-filling-with-keyboard-maestro-for-big-sur">similar post</a> I showed how to input information into a browser using <a href="https://keyboardmaestro.com">Keyboard Maestro</a>. </p>

<p>In this post I want to show another integration with your browser and show you how you can get content from your browser to do whatever you want with.</p>

<p>This technique uses Javascript to return the text of an HTML element and then it can be manipulated using Keyboard Maestro.</p>

<h2>Enable Javascript from Apple Events</h2>

<p>This setting (off by default prevents rogue applications from taking control of your browser). In most cases this is a great security measure but in our case, it breaks the Keyboard Maestro functionality.</p>

<h3>For Safari</h3>

<p>With Safari open go to <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the advanced column.</p>

<p>Check the box <em>Show Develop menu in menu bar</em></p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Show%20Develop%20Menu%20from%20MenuBar.png" alt="check the box show develop menu in menu bar" /></p>

<p>In the menu bar select the <em>Develop</em> menu and select the option <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Allow%20Javascript%20from%20Apple%20Events.png" alt="Enable Javascript from Apple Events" /></p>

<h3>For Chrome</h3>

<p>Chrome makes this a little easier. In the menu bar select <em>View</em>, then <em>Develop</em> (already visible) and select <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p>In both cases, you will see a check mark that indicates you are ready to Automate!</p>

<h2>Navigate to the page you wish to get data from</h2>

<p>You can use Keyboard Maestro's <strong>New Safari/Chrome Tab with URL</strong>. If you do this make sure that you wait until the page is fully loaded or data may not be collectable. Luckily there is a <em>Wait for Safari/Chrome to Finish Loading</em> action you can use.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/New%20Tab%20with%20URL.png" alt="New Safari/Chrome Tab" /></p>

<h2>Find the element that you wish to get the text of</h2>

<p>Highlight the selected text on the page. Right Click and select <em>Inspect Element</em> (or <em>Inspect</em> for Chrome). This will open the developer console with that selected element highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/inspect%20element-squashed.png" alt="Inspect Element" />
Right click the element and hover over copy and choose the <em>Selector Path</em> (in Chrome choose <em>copy selector</em>)</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/copy%20selector-squashed.png" alt="Copy Selector" /></p>

<h2>Use the <em>querySelector</em> method and <em>innerText</em> attribute</h2>

<p>Add the <strong>Execute Javascript in Safari/Chrome</strong> action and enter the following code.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>document.querySelector(&quot;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">PASTE</span> <span class="na">YOUR</span> <span class="na">COPIED</span> <span class="na">TEXT</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;).innerText`
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>document.querySelector</code> tells the browser to find the first element that matches your passed selection. Since you highlighted the text it will give you the most unique possible selection, so the first choice should be the correct one<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This however, <code>document.querySelector</code> gives you the full HTML element. So a paragraph would be</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>`
</code></pre></div>

<p>We don't need the <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> parts. Luckily we can use the <code>innerText</code> attribute. As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText">Mozilla</a> explains it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The innerText property of the HTMLElement interface represents the "rendered" text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To test this you can paste your code into the console of your browser (a tab in the developer console.) or you can set the action to display the results. When you have the right element you can pass that information as a variable to use later in your Keyboard Maestro workflow or you can save it to your clipboard to paste into another window. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>If you do need to get another version you can use <code>querySelectorAll(&lt;Your Element&gt;)</code> and choose the index that you're looking for.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Amazing Podcasting (and Content Creation) Advice from Professional Podcasters (WIP)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Work in Progress means this Post is Mostly Done, but things could change. You can help with that by telling me your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1325700577033007104?s=21">twitter</a></p>

<p>I talked with a few friends this week and got some wonderful insights around podcasting and podcast marketing. </p>

<p>This is some next level advice from folks that use podcasting for at least part of their livelihood so if you're interested, listen up. </p>

<h3>Don't Just Wing It</h3>

<p>Would you believe I recorded the solo content for <a href="/the-power-of-personal-freedom-david-sparks-on-speaking-around-multiple-interests">this week's PIT Show</a> THREE DIFFERENT TIMES!?</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xIZku8V0y7uqk/source.gif" alt="waste time" /></p>

<p>I like to just do a thing without overthinking it. That doesn't mean that I should just get on the mic and start rambling (That's what twitter is for... 😉)</p>

<p>Even coming up with a quick 5-10 bullet outline can really make a difference in how focused content is.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/david-sparks-notes.jpeg?tr=pr-true,w-1024,h-500,fo-top" alt="David Sparks Episode Notes" /></p>

<h3>There is nothing wrong with doing a bunch of things that (seem the same).</h3>

<p>In my quest to figure out what's going on with my podcast ambitions, one of my concerns was that I would produce something that was the PIT Show but with a different name. The reality is that I want to do the PIT show but I want to be able to seperate it from the world of productivity and the world of development.</p>

<p>The tech industry is dominated by companies that pitch themselves with "It's like <em>X</em> but <em>Y</em>". I feel like I can channel that to make some really good shows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One I'm thinking of off the top of my head is the <em>AntiProductivity Show</em> (Working Title) where I talk with folks that play with Productivity tools to discover the weaknesses in their systems. It's like a productivity show but honest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Half of my listeners are <em>tech workers</em> that are interested in productivity. The other half are <em>tech enthusiasts</em> that like my spin on productivity (or lack therof and my interviews).</p>

<h3>Limited Run Shows are great! There will be a lot of those in my future!</h3>

<p>One of the things I'm doing in my day job is working to come up with seasonal and limited run content. These would be interview series and YouTube things.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of limited run and narrow focused content. Being able to do things where that are super concentrated (in theory) should allow me to have smaller but more focused audiences that will come to grow the network around me. This means that over time, people will not come for the shows and instead will come to support the work that I put out. It also means that I don't have to feel bad if every project doesn't satisfy everyone in my audience. I can put out the things I want to put out and only continue the things that have enough support to expand on it. </p>

<h3>Cut a Demo</h3>

<p>Whether you are pitching a project to a major network or just planning your next project, be sure to record a few demos. These will not see the light of day but they are a good way to get in the groove. </p>

<p>It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to give you and others an idea for what the plan is. This will help you find your show's voice better and give you something to pass to friends so that they can tell you it's a great idea!!</p>

<h3>Always Leave Them Wanting Something (to eat?)</h3>

<p>Another way to word this is that you don't have to let out EVERYTHING in one recording. Some of the best conversations I've had with folks started with a rather vague or snippet of a thought and then evolved into a larger examination into the subject.</p>

<p>I talk too much. The word count on this proves that. In fact this entire post was a newsletter email at first and turned into the first TIFOTR and this post when I realized that no one wants to have 1500 words sitting in their inbox. </p>

<p>That's another thing give them what they want. </p>

<p>Here is an example on that idea.</p>

<p>You are podcasting about an idea like, "<em>Why Cheesecake is the best pie ever</em>" (Fight me!). In the episode, you mention the variety of cheesecakes, the creaminess and the ease of preparation and cost (about 10 minutes). You could share some of your favorite recipes but instead you decide to make that a blog post (about 500 words and some good links 😋). Lastly, in a newsletter post you mention why cheesecake isn't a cake and link to your thoughts while inviting your subscribers to try and convince you otherwise. (a quick 100 words)</p>

<p>In this way you've gotten all your thoughts out, but you left your audiences wanting to engage you on the subject and a few places to start.</p>

<p>BTW I don't have a post on cheesecake and I would be fine with a frozen one from the local grocer, but those are my thoughts and those of a few friends and now you have them 😄.</p>

<title>Mortems: You Should Do Those</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by an app idea I had a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Here is some advice you can use for a Pre/Post Mortems.</p>

<h2>Defined Terms:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/seeing-what-others-dont/202101/the-pre-mortem-method">Pre-Mortem</a>: A meeting prior to the start of the project to gather ideas around a project that can identify key goals and potential pitfalls.</li>
<li>Post-Mortem: Feedback once the project has been completed from those involved that identify the rights and wrongs of the project to help make better decisions in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems:</h2>

<h3>Mortems are hard to template</h3>

<p>Every project is different and will require some thought. That said you can start with the basics:</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Mortem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What OKRs will define the success of this project?</li>
<li>What barriers will prevent us from reaching success in this project?
<ul>
<li>Is there anything we can do to reduce the potential of these barriers?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Who are the stakeholders and what defines success to them?</li>
<li>Will this project impact folks outside of our team? How involved should they be in this process?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Post-Mortem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Based on the OKRs that we set, was the project successful? Did stakeholders find it successful as well?</li>
<li>Did we prevent the expected barriers from arising?</li>
<li>What unexpected barriers came up?</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's good to remember:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>There should be no judgement and all voices should be heard. If you feel this would be challenging then work to anonymize the input.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite Hard/Soft connections to project to participate in the conversation</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard Connect - someone that will/has worked on the project</li>
<li>Soft Connect - someone impacted by the project (stakeholders, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make sure to keep a record of the Pre/Post Mortems as they can be helpful in the future.</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Fish Resources</title>  <description><![CDATA[<div class="notification is-dark">
<div class="content">
<h2 class="has-text-light">Update:</h2>
<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<p>I do a lot of work in the terminal. I understand that for many it's the lack of glitz and glamour that keeps people away from it, and while the majority of my computer usage is in some GUI, there are still many things that I can do much faster using a script that I can launch from my terminal.</p>

<p>Fish (Short for Friendly Interactive Shell) was a great attempt to add some modern-ness to the terminal environment. That said it has been around since the 90's as this boutique experience that some love, many ignore, and even more fear. </p>

<p>Well, fear not. Here are a few links that can help introduce you to fish and help you get out the gate quickly.</p>

<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 08 Nov 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">sponsoring all my projects</a>! </p>

<h3>TLDR:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast - Session Manager</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asciinema.org">Asciinema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-tripod-mount-for-magsafe/">Moment Magsafe Mount</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcEBQ0K3UsQ8bzWKHKQmbw">Struthless</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yousub.info/">PocketTube</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast - Session Manager</a></h3>

<p>I've tried many a browser session manager. Most of them are good and bad in their own way. <a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast</a> is another attempt at one. Luckily it checks all the boxes and is a great way for me to export lists when I'm doing research. Here are the important features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross Browser</li>
<li>A Sustainable Business Model</li>
<li>The ability to add to existing sessions</li>
<li>The ability to edit and rename tabs in sessions</li>
<li>The ability to rename sessions</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/toast-session.png?tr=w-500" alt="Toast Example" /></p>

<p>I think that this has some unique features that may work well with tools like <a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hook</a> as each session has it's own unique link that you can share.</p>

<h3><a href="https://asciinema.org">Asciinema</a></h3>

<p>I think that video is in many ways better than writing out steps (except for accessibility). </p>

<p>I was originally going to use t-rec which I got from one of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/10/13/web-excursions-for-october-13-2020/">Brett Terpstra's Webscursions</a>, but couldn't get rust working with my setup and just couldn't be bothered. </p>

<p>[Asciinema] is a way to record your terminal session and share it with others. You can also use the replay feature to rerun steps on your local machine (Which I'm tempted to do as a new device setup script. I shared an example of how I look at how <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-twitter-lists">I visualize data from a few of my twitter lists</a> using it.</p>

<p><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/8lnUCpYqt9FalwB3jPvexfRHz.svg" alt="asciicast" /></p>

<p>I think that in the future my project will probably feature an Ascicast video showing how to use it.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-tripod-mount-for-magsafe/">Moment Magsafe Tripod Mounts</a></h3>

<p><strong>THESE AREN'T OUT YET.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/moment-magsafe-phone-mount.jpeg?tr=w-850" alt="Moment Magsafe Tripod Mounts" /></p>

<p>I wasn't planning on getting a new phone until I saw this
[Moment Magsafe Mount]. That combined with EpocCam (now owned by Elgato) makes a wonderful quick attach/detach mount webcam using my iPhone (well the future iphone 12 something I would own).</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcEBQ0K3UsQ8bzWKHKQmbw">Struthless</a> (YouTube)</h3>

<p>[Struthless] is an awesome channel that I've found recently and have been watching a lot. Campbell Walker shares stories, insights and a kickass attitude that after watching I usually just hit the next one and keep going.</p>

<p>Here a great video about drawing a cat and a very similar feeling I have about distractions.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44H76Bbvung" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3><a href="https://yousub.info/">PocketTube</a></h3>

<p>Speaking of YouTube, I've been trying to figure out better ways to manage YouTube. </p>

<p>[PocketTube] allows you to organize YouTube channels into groups and view recent videos that are in those groups. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/pockettube2.png?tr=500" alt="Pockettube 2.0" /></p>

<p>This is great because I can find videos that all match a type that I'm feeling.</p>

<p>One downside to it is that is that you have to manually add each video, so I'm using a system like the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-noguchi-filing-system-keeps-paper-documents-organiz-1593529432"><em>Noguchi Method</em></a> where I just organize a channel as I subscribe to it or visit a channel that I am already subscribed to. (I am subbed to over 900 channels. I don't have that kind of time...)</p>

<title>I Can&#39;t Be the Only One Seeing This</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>What are people yelling about?</p>

<p>I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to give a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regarding how their policy affected underrepresented groups. </p>

<p>The responses were:</p>

<ul>
<li>people praising the OP for their bravery</li>
<li>people shouting "What about candidate z?"</li>
<li>people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do</li>
<li>People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their own agenda</li>
</ul>

<p>The fear I have is, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at. In the end NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED.</p>

<p>I don't even know looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity? ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZbUOH7pbDiNSmU1x4o/giphy.gif" alt="My thoughts" /></p>

<p>I'm considering checking out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networking opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth dealing with the things I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. </p>

<ul>
<li>Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity</li>
<li>Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis</li>
<li>Cats doing amazing tricks</li>
<li>Videos of people failing so hard</li>
<li>Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques</li>
<li>Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle</li>
<li>People motivation folks around them that are crying out for help</li>
<li>People crying out for help!</li>
<li>People that are openly doubt their knowledge but are still putting themselves out there because they hope people will support them.</li>
<li>People building things to learn and are wanting feedback</li>
<li>People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems</li>
</ul>

<p>The guys at <a href="https://internetfriends.show">Internet Friends</a> proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.</p>

<p>"I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day."</p>

<p>To expand on that, I would love it so that you can only see the replies. If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.</p>

<p>I've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). </li>
<li>I'm tired of being told to yell at people. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm just SO TIRED. 😭</p>

<p>Dear Social Media Companies:
    I don't care about followers anymore.</p>

<pre><code>Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. 

I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line. 

Don't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?
</code></pre>

<p>Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. </p>

<p>I'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.</p>

<p>I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.</p>

<p>The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. </p>

<p>... OK BOOMER ...</p>

<title>On Blizzard/Activision lawsuit</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of y'all know that my podcasting/streaming/video knowledge has some origins in gaming. I'm actually a part of a esports team as a marketing consultant.</p>

<p>Activision/Blizzard, makers of a game that I have invested THOUSANDS of hours in both playing and creating content for was recently <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture">sued by the state of California</a> for exhibiting sexist and lude behavior towards their female employees.</p>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong>
Companies are:</p>

<p>A. Made up of people. Terrible people make a terrible culture. Often the actions of the terrible folks make life hell for the folks just wanting to do their job.
B. First and foremost about making a profit. If you want to make culture change, stop allowing companies to profit from bad behaviourl</p>

<p>I recently stopped creating content that supports this company and I am appalled. While no behavior from companies surprise me anymore, I want to take the time to remind folks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be Excellent to one another</li>
<li>Believe that people work as hard as you do and deserve what you deserve (unless you are a shit person).</li>
<li>Believe people when they say they aren't being treated fairly. Profiting off of pity is extremely rare. People put themselves at risk of retaliation when they speak up.</li>
<li>Say something when you see it. A culture that causes people to leave their dream industry is not a culture worth protecting.</li>
<li>It's important for people to feel like they can trust the people they work with. If you did something terrible admit it, show remorse for your actions, take time to learn from it, and make sure you work to become an ally and support the same people you hurt.</li>
<li>Don't push underrepresented folks to come to your side and be the mediator. If behavior is wrong, it's wrong and the people that are defending your bad stance are mostly doing it to progress in their job and take care of the things that are most important to them.</li>
<li>Don't just think people can quit. I worked a job I didn't like for almost a decade dreaming of
the day I would be able to get away from it. Also I shouldn't have to quit because the people
around me are terrible. You don't fix bad behavior by quitting and letting it
continue.</li>
</ul>

<title>Transcriptor now Supports SRT Upload and Conversion</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I was tasked with a new transcription project.</p>

<p>The project was to create subtitles for a few videos with the intention of expanding the job to several hours of work if the work was good enough quality. While I was certain that I could figure it out, <em>Transcriptor</em> was designed for custom text templates, not the standard SRT format. So instead of doing manual conversion of these files I decided to put the work in to make <em>Transcriptor</em> support both the importing and exporting of SRT files. This meant also for the first time working with the end_times in text markers and focusing on getting timing down to the exact word. </p>

<p>While there were wonderful options to work with SRT files I knew that I would want to build my own variation of an SRT engine. This was mostly because of future plans for transcriptor which for the first time I'm putting out there. </p>

<p>You can create a <code>Job</code> object from an srt using <code>Job.from_srt()</code>. and passing in the filepath of the object.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transcriptor</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Job</span>

<span class="n">NewSRTJob</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Job</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_srt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./srt_file.srt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This give you the ability to create new objects from this job (currently a text transcription file). You also have the ability to break down the transcription word by word and by marker. This gives you the ability to apply shifts to all or some of the srt files without having to re-index the project.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">marker</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">NewSRTJob</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">markers</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">marker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_time</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span>
    <span class="n">marker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_time</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span>

<title>Showing the Toothfairy Icon only when my Airpods Pro are Connected</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="https://macbartender.com">Bartender 4</a> released with a couple of features that I was super stoked about. </p>

<p>One of those updates was the ability to add custom rules for showing/hiding icons based. Wanting to play with this more I created a watcher shell script for showing/hiding the <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> icon.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/ToothFairy%20Toggle.png" alt="Bartender Showing Toothfairy" /></p>

<p>The end result of this script is that when my Airpods Pro are connected to the device, the toothfairy icon will appear in the menu bar. Once the Airpods Pro are disconnected the icon will go back to being hidden. This means that I can quickly tell when my AirPods Pro are connected to my machine (even if they are also connected to my phone or iPad).</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/bartender-toothfairy-disabled.png" alt="Airpods are not connected and the icon is in the secondary Bartender Bar" /></p>

<h2>The Script</h2>

<p>I found the command for getting your Bluetooth settings just tabbing through terminal commands. </p>

<p><code>AP_STAT=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A9 "Jay’s AirPods Pro:")</code></p>

<p>This saves the information for any bluetooth device named <em>Jay's AirPods Pro</em> to <code>AP_STAT</code> (Airpods Status).</p>

<p>I got help from this similar idea from <a href="https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airpodspro-battery">Godbout's Alfred Workflow</a>. </p>

<p><code>echo $AP_STAT | awk '/Connected: Yes/{print 1}'</code></p>

<p>echo prints the data and awk is a <em>text manipulation</em> command. It looks for the pattern <code>Connnected: Yes</code> and returns a 1 if it is found (otherwise it returns nothing).</p>

<p>Bartender looks for a <em>True</em> value which <code>1</code> is. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/toothfairy-bartender-enabled.png" alt="Airpods are Enabled and the icon is showing in the main menubar" /></p>

<p>Here's the whole script</p>

<pre><code>AP_STAT=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A9 "Jay’s AirPods Pro:")
echo $AP_STAT | awk '/Connected: Yes/{print 1}'
</code></pre>

<p>Both <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> and <a href="https://macbartender.com">Bartender 4</a> (available on Big Sur ONLY) are both a part of <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/6bcd77a8-3223-482b-bcd2-ff337999765d">SetApp (Affiliate Link)</a></p>

<title>5 People that made my 2020 🔥</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've mentioned this before. As much as 2020 sucked for the world, it was one of my biggest professional years of growth.</p>

<p>Most of this growth came from connecting and communicating with some amazing folks in my extended digital community.</p>

<p>This was originally a podcast episode, but since I was experiencing some audio issues I decided to convert this into a blog post celebrating some people that made an huge impact on me in 2020.</p>

<h2><a href="https://compassionatecoding.com">April Wensel</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/AprilWensel-about.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="April Wensel" /></p>

<p>April Wensel is the founder of <a href="https://compassionatecoding.com">Compassionate Coding</a>, a company focused on increasing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0kzU4Pu-Q">emotional intelligence</a> of developer teams. April and I connect regularly with each other as 2020 impacted us in many ways. April was a foundational part of #GetJayADevJob and has even helped to make some amazing connections to get my first few months as a Dev Advocate off to a great start.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.willingconsulting.com">Carol Willing</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/carolwilling-twitter.jpg?tr=w-400" alt="Carol Willing" /></p>

<p>Carol was the first person to comment on one of my coding projects. This was back in 2014 when I was just learning Python and my code wasn't wonderful. Still, Carol saw beyond my non-perfect code and saw the practicality of the work.</p>

<p>Fast forward 6 years Carol reached out to me asking to help me on my job journey. She provided great resume advice and has kept up with what I've been working on. She's even helped me think about some of the <a href="https://render-engine.readthedocs.org">Render Engine</a>.</p>

<p>Carol is a great leader in the Python community and has mentored many great folks in the tech industry. I am glad to be included in her illustrious list.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/caffodian">Alex Tsai</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/AlexTsai-twitter.jpg?tr=w-400" alt="Alex Tsai" /></p>

<p>I will be honest, Alex was someone that I met in the middle of my job hunt because I was hoping to work for him. That said, even when I took a different role I was worried it would destroy the relationship that I had made with him. That said I feel like we've spoken more since.</p>

<p>Alex also gave me great advice for my resume and has also been a great Python mentor. I hope that I can find ways to work with Alex in the future but I know, if that doesn't happen, then Alex and I will still continue to connect with one another.</p>

<h2><a href="https://bdougie.live">Brian Douglas</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/briandouglas-linkedin.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="Brian Douglas" /></p>

<p>Brian and I have known each other for several years but this was the year where we connected most and it came at a time where I was looking for an advocate that I could learn from.</p>

<p>Brian was one of the first advocates that I met that was able to successfully pivot from on stage presenting to regular streams. He's been creating a wonderful community and tools for <a href="https://opensauced.pizza">helping folks contribute to open source</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/alexcox">Alex Cox</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/AlexCox-SpaceHelmet.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="Alex Cox" /></p>

<p>I've wanted to interview Alex for years! Now that it's finally happened (This weeks episode of <em>the PIT show</em>!). </p>

<p>Alex is a wonderful person that has so much experience. They've been podcasting since before it was cool. They've evolve their mentality around productivity, learning, experimentation and progress. It's amazing that they are able to shape and impact folks considered legendary in tech podcasting. </p>

<p>Accompanying their technical prowess, they also are a wealth of knowledge and understanding in challenging life-topics such as mental-health, gender, and transitions. On top of that, Alex has the ability to ask questions that get to the heart of the matter. This is an excellent skill that I hope I can improve on.</p>

<p>More than anything, since recording with Alex we've kept in touch and I've learned a ton from them.</p>

<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>

<h3>You</h3>

<p>I mean this. I've met so many wonderful people this year that have been nothing but supportive to me. I don't have the largest audience on the internet so if you are reading this, we've probably spoken at least once. </p>

<p>If we haven't spoken yet, be sure to <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a>. </p>

<title>Can we fix this?</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been mostly silent in this time, mostly as I needed time to think
about what I would like to see come out of all this.</p>

<h2>How to Fix Racism</h2>

<p>Racism is all over the world. Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.</p>

<p>I don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and
become equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.
Instead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust
punishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never
able to gain any amount of legitimate growth.</p>

<p>Force the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that
are disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest
person of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the
only one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.</p>

<p>If you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely
(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for
you.</p>

<h2>On Rioting</h2>

<p>In my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.
Furthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me
from my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked
to be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and
the fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint
and had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took
them from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the
age of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop
car over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,
uneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you
have pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local
communities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation
of Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict
government oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.</p>

<p>It took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is
founded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we
murdered until we got it.</p>

<p>We did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to
ourselves (see civil war).</p>

<p>Now when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our
nation call us Terrorists.</p>

<p>While I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and
maintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying
the example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those
that murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while
the rest of society looked away.</p>

<h2>On The Legal System</h2>

<p>In regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who
have the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout
my wishes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down</li>
<li>More racial and gender diversity in police forces</li>
<li>Mandatory implicit bias checks and training</li>
<li>Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making
an arrest.</li>
<li>The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws</li>
</ul>

<p>These ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how
they can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that
can't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up
for themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly. And be willing to listen when we do speak up.</p>

<title>Changes for PIT and New Projects on the Horizon</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you want to know the changes coming up, then listen to this.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/0e037bba"></iframe>

<p>Now here's the scoop. </p>

<p><strong>The PIT Podcast will be winding down.</strong> I will be releasing the remaining interviews in their raw format with the aftershow's included.</p>

<p><strong>I will be starting an audio newsletter that will be premium only, meaning you will need to pay for the audio version which will include interviews</strong>. More on that in the future as I'm trying to get the logistics of that ironed out.</p>

<p><strong>I'm working on a potential book</strong> or a really long blog post.</p>

<p><strong>My blog will get a little more buckshot</strong>. This means that I will be talking about a bunch of things.</p>

<p><strong>The newsletter will be more valuable as it will have a recap of all the things I'm working on</strong>. Please subscribe.</p>

<p><strong>My future in podcasting will be limited run shows...And maybe a show with a friend</strong> Still working on things there but safe to say new projects will be limited run seasons with other things around them.</p>

<p><strong>Taking a break with new clients for PIT</strong>. I need time to focus on my health and happiness and some of the projects that I'm working on. I will continue to make things that I want to make, but I won't be taking new clients at the moment.</p>

<title>TIL You can change the subject of an Email</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I'm not here to bash <em>Hey</em>. In fact I wouldn't have thought of this idea if
it weren't for them so great job!</strong></p>

<p>I was setting up my (Non-M1) mac mini to do some work and I needed to setup my
email system (currently [MailMate]). While doing this, I didn't have the "gmail" hotkeys enabled so I was trying to
figure out how to enter the search field when I hit ctrl+s and I got a very interesting window.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Mailmate%20Change%20Subject%20Box.png" alt="Change Subject Screenshot" /></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this was a feature that <em>Hey</em> was promoting as a feature.</p>

<p>Upon reading the <em>caveats</em>, I realized what MailMate was doing. Essentially it
was rewriting the mail with new headers (Which was why it was saying it would
appear as a new message in other clients.)</p>

<p>This made me realize that if this was that big of a deal you could simply forward the message to yourself with a
new subject... </p>

<p>Sometimes the solution isn't elegant. Still it's a solution.</p>

<title>Enhancing Civics Data with Elasticsearch, pandas and Eland</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many cities in the United States provide data as a part of the oversight initiatives and federal compliance. However, datasets often present information in incomplete or hard-to-compare formats.</p><p>This talk will break down how to compile data from the San Diego Police Department into pandas dataframes and use geopandas, eland, and Elasticsearch to enrich the data with approximate GeoPoints so that it can be visualized in Kibana or a public plotting platform.</p>

<title>In Defense of the Black Multi-Potentialite</title>  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><em>Stay in Your Lane.</em> - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Shut up and Dribble.</em> - Laura Ingraham</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why does every black actor gotta rap some. I don't know. All I know is I'm the best one.</em> - Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.</p>

<p>For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.</p>

<p>For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. </p>

<p>I joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>But Why</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what is a man, what has he got?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not himself, then he has naught</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say the things he truly feels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And not the words of one who kneels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The record shows, I took the blows</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. </p>

<p>In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.</p>

<p>When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).</p>

<p>In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.</p>

<h3>I do a lot.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I work a Day job.</li>
<li>I manage a <a href="https://productivityintech.com">side business</a> helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller">write code</a>.</li>
<li>I host a range of <a href="/projects">podcasts</a> from tech to gaming.</li>
<li>I'm a member of an Esports organization and <a href="https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller">stream regularly</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My <em>coding</em> skills help me <strong>automate</strong> and <strong>optimize</strong> my day job.</p>

<p>My <em>day job</em> skills, challenge me to <strong>think differently</strong> and <strong>shake up stale thought</strong>.</p>

<p>My <em>podcasting</em> and <em>streaming</em> skills gave me the ability to identify ways that <strong>I could help my
side-business clients</strong> in <strong>their</strong> content-creating journey.</p>

<p>They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. </p>

<p>I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. </p>

<p>Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.</p>

<p>Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.</p>

<p>My child will grow up seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.</p>

<title>Announcing Conduit on Relay.FM</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to announce my new project, <a href="https://relay.fm/conduit">Conduit</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://relay.fm/conduit"><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/conduit_artwork.png" alt="Conduit" /></a></p>

<p><em>Conduit</em> is a new show on RelayFM! I'll be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/mrssoup">Kathy Campbell</a> as we tackle productivity in a personal, realistic, and hopefully fun and engaging way!</p>

<p>This show covers productivity topics in both work and life that don't have a hashtag. Topics like <em>I get jealous of all my friends' success and it makes me feel like a failure!</em> or <em>How can I make my work projects seem as fun as my projects in Minecraft!</em></p>

<p>We're not promoting a methodology or a system. We aren't productivity professionals with articles, blog posts, courses, or books to promote! There won't be much talk about the apps or tools that we use (maybe a little in Episode 1, but that's intentional). </p>

<p>We believe we have the tools to do your best work in that moment. We just need to thinking about how  we're using them and making some small adjustments.</p>

<p>We'll share our experiences and try small experiments to see what happens. In the show, Kathy and I will commit to an episode, themed goal to give us the productivity boost we were looking for. Some will work, some will fail (It be like that sometimes). We encourage you to come up with your own connections and tell us how things are going using #MyConduit <a href="https://twitter.com/conduitfm">on twitter</a>. We'll review and share results on the following episode.</p>

<p>I hope you'll join us! <a href="https://relay.fm/0">Episode 0</a> is out now and the first episode launches later this week! You can subscribe using your podcatcher of choice today!</p>

<title>My New Job and What that Means for All the Things I Do</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>For the last 5 months<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, I've applied for many Software Engineering and Developer Advocate Roles.</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce, starting next month, I will be working with <a href="https://elastic.co">Elastic</a> as a Developer Advocate.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/brand-elastic-sop-lockup-220x130.svg" alt="elastic logo" /></p>

<h2>What About PIT?</h2>

<p>Productivity in Tech means so much to me. I've been reassured that the work that I do with PIT can continue.</p>

<p>That said, I have made the decision will not be accepting new clients while I transition into this new role.</p>

<h2>What About Your Projects?</h2>

<p>You can expect a <em>small</em> reduction in <em>new feature work</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> while I'm adjusting to the new role. All the projects that I have been working on are Open-Source (MIT Licensed). everyone is welcome to make open source contributions to them.</p>

<h2>What About Content?</h2>

<p>The blog content will continue at it's <em>irregularly-scheduled</em> pace.</p>

<p>The PIT Podcast has enough episodes lined up for the rest of the year <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>
There is no current plan to stop doing the PIT Podcast with the alternating format.</p>

<p>Elastic is aware of the other projects I co-host and has no intention in asking me to stop any of them.</p>

<p>My livestreams are currently going to continue on a 4-5 times a week pace. This could reduce if I start streaming on behalf of my employer. There are no official plans at the moment.</p>

<h2>So Why Elastic</h2>

<p>So I hope that I have shown you a little of the attitude and enviroment that Elastic presented to me. There were many amazing things about the company that made me happy to be considered for the role. But there was one thing they did very well.</p>

<p><strong>They have a successful history of hiring outside of tech.</strong></p>

<p>This opportunity came to me because of <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1292930503125823488?s=20">some wonderful people in the industry</a>. I had amazing folks on my side, and I want to make sure that I can point folks to potential opportunities as as well. I want to work with companies that see folks from outside of traditional tech as valuable as <em>classically</em> trained individuals.</p>

<p>During the interview process, I had the pleasure to talk with several people at Elastic who, before working with the company, considered themselves <em>non-techical</em>. These were people in leadership roles. This showed me people have an opportunity to grow inside the company even if they lack the history that tends to be a gate preventing people from moving up in their career.</p>

<h2>When can you See Me "At Work"?</h2>

<p>Around the same time I accepted the position, I selected to speak at the <a href="https://pygotham.tv">PyGotham Virtual Online Conference</a> to speak about <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/transcriptor">Transcriptor</a>. I will showcase how I using the Elastic Stack to make transcriptions easier for developers!</p>

<p>There is nothing to report on live-streaming, blogging, podcasting, or speaking on behalf of Elastic. There have been some conversations and there will be some opportunities. I am happy to bring my skills to the team in whatever ways they feel would make the best impact!</p>

<p>I look forward to the future with Elastic!</p>

<title>The PIT Show Post Mortem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>I recently did a post-mortem for the PIT Show (formerly known as the Productivity in Tech Podcast). I wanted to break down the takeaways I got from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Success</h2>

<p>Let's talk about what success was in the show. At its peak the show got about 1,500 downloads per episode. The show ended with approximately 250 downloads per episode.</p>

<h3>Short Term Success in Cliches</h3>

<p>The show started out talking about the apps that people I saw on the internet used. I soon became bored feeling that the show was exactly the same, but the numbers didn't lie. There was a significant drop off after the topics shifted. </p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, projects like this should limited in length. Each run, try to get unique uses and a connection between the episodes to be cohesive.</p>

<h3>Long Term Success in Knowledge/Relationships</h3>

<p>I was able to do interviews for several years. I made amazing friends and connections to people. Those connections lead to bigger projects. My current boss mentioned my interview skills made me a  good candidate for my current role.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, remember the people you connect with. Make friends and have great conversations. It's these things that will make you more money/exposure/etc. </p>

<h2>Never Nuke a Project Twice</h2>

<p>I blew up the feed when it could have been an archive. When I brought the show back I could have put it all on the original feed.</p>

<p>The second time I announced a rebranding and change to the format. This did not work.</p>

<p>After a year I brought it back under the old name. People asked many times why I was announcing new shows but they weren't showing up on the feed.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, DO NOT MAKE YOUR BRAND THE NAME OF THE SHOW. Also, beware of nuclear options.</p>

<h2>People Ask Great Questions</h2>

<p>Guests loved the ability to interview me. The best interviews always had great questions. The most memorable after shows were well over an hour.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong> GIVE PEOPLE PLATFORMS! Let them do things they've wanted to do. Make space for that, because it will produce some great results.</p>

<h2>Learn from What They Don't Show</h2>

<p>Good interviewers get good answers from their guests. The best interviews get answers no one else has gotten. The best way to do this is avoid the obvious questions and dig deeper.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, be selective about who you interview. Really push your interviewee to answer questions never before asked.</p>

<h2>It's Hard to Go at It Alone</h2>

<p>This show would have been better with a producer, editor, artist, and social media manager. trying to do all these things by myself  lead to burnout.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, limit your role on the show. Don't do things on your own unless in very limited scope (limited run shows with a lot of prep-work).</p>

<h2>Prepare, Don't Over Prepare</h2>

<p>A big change was adding the questionnaire. It made the prep-work easier. That said pre-loaded questions made the show feel boring.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, prepare for the show but don't overdo it.</p>

<h2>Experiments are Good</h2>

<p>I tried many things. some worked and some didn't. </p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, have a place to try things. If they go well keep doing it. If not, oh well.</p>

<h2>You Won't Please Everyone</h2>

<p>I ran several polls asking about the interview format vs the solo-reflection format.</p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, make your project single-focused. It's okay to have many projects especially if you have help.</p>

<h2>Just Ask (Sometimes More Than Once)</h2>

<p>It did take a couple of asks to bring people onto the show. Sometimes they were down but not available. 
<strong>In the future</strong>, be patient and do  (unless they say "No" then respect their wishes)</p>

<h2>Engagement &gt; Listeners</h2>

<p>Engagement gives you insight to what your most engaged fans want. You will make more money per engaged person vs those listening but not engaging.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, focus on your audience. Make content for them. Growth will happen until it doesn't. It's the folks that support you that you should be connecting with and learning from and serving.</p>

<h2>Communities are best when small</h2>

<p>The community around PIT's podcast was at its best when it was never about PIT. </p>

<p><strong>In the future</strong>, if your podcast is in service to a community, just serve the community. If they feel a podcast is necessary, then do the podcast.</p>

<h1>Big Takeaway</h1>

<h2>It Would Have Been Better as More Than One Show</h2>

<p>The PIT Show was full of experiments and conversations that I wanted to have. In the realm of productivity, that show died several years ago. If I wanted to interview amazing people, I could have made a show doing so. If I wanted to have my own reflections show I should have done (and I did do) that.</p>

<p>The show would have ended in a more concise and consistent experience.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>This calculation could fall apart if ad-revenue is introduced. Usually at that level you have a lot of engagement still.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>The Cost of Running with Scratched Itches</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have friends that make things. They also inspire me to make things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me - OMG Massive product update! But for real, when you going to charge for this...?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Friend - Can you imagine the support time if it were a paid product?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think of myself as an <em>itch scratcher</em> or somoneone who does things because they want to do things. I blame my ADHD. Once the itch has been scratched I move on to the next itch. There's probably a metaphor about "leaving scars" there but I'll not belabor the point.</p>

<p>This is a little reminder that when you build a thing, there are little costs that come with doing it. Sometimes it's better to layout that your itch <strong>is just an itch</strong> and leave it at that.</p>

<title>Kaotica Eyeball</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I first learned about the <a href="https://www.kaoticaeyeball.com">Kaotica Eyeball</a> from a video by Hip Hop Artist <a href="">Ruslan</a>. In the video he mentioned using it to record vocals that would later appear on one of his albums. While consulting for a former employer, I took the opportunity to order one for them to record in their office. I was impressed with the quality of the acoustic foam and how well it blocked out noise. I hoped that I could use it to block out some unwanted noise from our (and our neighbor's) dogs.</p>

<p>I was saddened to still have the barks come through in our recording. While I thought about returning the eyeball, I decided to use the recording and I'm happy to say that it improved the quality of my audio in a few ways.</p>

<p>I guess I'll be keeping the eyeball. If you want to hear how it sounds, check out this <a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/25">episode of the PIT Show</a>.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/6ecb6cf5"></iframe>

<p>In that episode I removed my normal <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx/features.htmll">RX Plugins</a>:
- Vocal De-Noise
- De-Reverb
- De Plosive</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Audio Chains.png" alt="RX Audio Chains" /></p>

<p>This retained some of the natural quality in the recording. While I don't think many people would notice a difference in quality, there is definitely a difference. But this also reduces my processing time and resources required on podcast and videos.</p>

<p>I am not ready to say that this is the $200 solution that every producer would need, but for those home-studio podcasters whose space is being encroached on in during the pandemic it will definitely be a help (albeit expensive) to improve audio on your track.</p>

<title>Friends have been my Greatest Asset!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been letting folks know about my <a href="https://productivityintech.com/coaching">coaching</a> and <a href="https://productivityintech.com/editing">editing</a> services more and more these days. </p>

<p>It's been a slow progressing growth. This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. </p>

<h2>Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.</h2>

<p>I've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. </p>

<p>100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis <strong>or</strong> they were recommended by the aforementioned person.</p>

<p>While I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.</p>

<p>I know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. </p>

<h2>Ways to do this</h2>

<h3>1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.</h3>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg" alt="" />
<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small></p>

<p>One of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. </p>

<p>Each of them have their own reach and their own network. 
I've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. </p>

<p>I've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. </p>

<h3>2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method</h3>

<p>Some relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the <a href="https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/">Noguchi Filing Method</a>. </p>

<p>The Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. 
<img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. </p>

<h3>3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)</h3>

<p>I got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and "unicorn" services.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a list of the services I provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My skills include:
  - social media
  - recording videos and screencasts
  - podcast editing and recording
  - community management
  - newsletter publishing</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. </p>

<p>I didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.</p>

<p>One person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.</p>

<p>The other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. </p>

<p>================</p>

<p>None of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this <em>grimy</em> feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your "inner-circle" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.</p>

<title>Quickly Set Your Environment with Bunch and Alfred</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/">Bunch</a> is an environment setup/teardown tool by the <a href="https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/episodes/podcast-ground-surfing-with-brett-terpstra">mad genius and yoga maestro of the internet</a> Brett Terpstra.</p>

<p>Bunch uses small configuration files to quickly manipulate your desktop environment. </p>

<p>With it you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open/Close/Focus Applications, Files, and URLs</li>
<li>Run shell and Applescript scripts to expand the functionality event more</li>
</ul>

<p>Because I prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard and the Application's main method of use is the Dock, I opted to take advantage of Bunch's URL-Scheme. </p>

<pre><code>x-bunch://open?bunch=[Bunch Name]
</code></pre>

<p>This plus smart use of the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/"><em>File Filter</em></a> in Alfred's workflow feature allowed me to quickly setup an <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Alfred Workflow</a> that not only lets you run your bunches but also lets you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display the Config File of the Bunch.</li>
<li>Edit the Bunch in your default application.</li>
<li>Refresh your Bunches (After making a change)</li>
</ul>

<p>The workflow is available on <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/bunch-quick-launch">Packal</a> to modify via my <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Github Repo</a></p>

<title>How I AutoUpdate My Github README using GitHub Actions in 5 Easy Steps</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>A new phenominon in the developer space is now the 🌟<em>secret</em>🌟 README.md
trick. If you have a repository with the EXACT (case-sensitive) name as your username, it will display the contents of that readme onto your GitHub profile.</p>

<p>Some folks have done really cool things with it, including setting up your own
Myspace-esque top8 (including Tom!).</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check it out. I made MySpace but on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>.<a href="https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR">https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR</a> - My list is power by a GitHub Action workflow 😏 <a href="https://t.co/PN80mFCqOE">pic.twitter.com/PN80mFCqOE</a></p>&mdash; Brian Douglas (@bdougieYO) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieYO/status/1281699715466199040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">Simon Willison's</a> amazing self-updating profile, I wanted to do something similar.</p>

<p>Armed with the power of python (<em>and anime on my side</em>), I setout to do something similar. This is a look at the first steps of me automating my Github Profile.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Rename the repo my website to a repo named after my GitHub username</h3>

<p>This is easy enough. Just rename the repo (in Github) to your username.
Remember this has to be exact and it is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>You can do this in the settings menu of your repo. You don't have to change the
directory names or anything like that on a local machine. (I'm not sure if you
are using a Git Client other than the cli).</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a copy of your existing readme as a template</h3>

<p>My goal was to create my README using a Jinja2 and Github Actions. For that I
would need a template to render. So since most of the data was the same I just
copied my existing README.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Dynamic Content using Jinja2 Variables</h3>

<p>Starting out I wanted to show my latest blog post and my latest podcast episode
from <a href="https://podcast.productivityiintech.com">Productivity in Tech Podcast</a>. We will create a python script that does
this, but we needed to add the variables that Jinja2 would use for the dynamic
data.</p>

<p>You could do something like a search and replace, but I feel like just
rendering a template is much easier to edit and understand. Also, the compute
time for Github Actions is free and this doesn't need to be the most
performance conscious program. Also I like Jinja2, so there is also that 🙃.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gh"># From README_template.md</span>

You can see what he&#39;s posting about at &lt;https://kjaymiller.com&gt;.

<span class="gs">**Latest Post - [{{latest_post.title}}]({{latest_post.link}})**</span>

<span class="gs">**Latest Productivity in Tech Podcast Episode - [{{latest_podcast_post.title}}]({{latest_podcast_post.link}})**</span>

<span class="gu">## Active Projects</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Step 4: Build your script to get the data and write the up to date README.md</h3>

<p>This script is pretty simple once you know what you're looking for. I'm using
the feedparser plugin to parse the rss feeds and then returning the title and
link for the latest episode.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">feedparser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">latest_post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sorted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;entries&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;published_parsed&#39;</span><span class="p">])[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;link&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;link&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then you set the template to the text of your template file.
 then write the rendered text to your README.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># update readme</span>
<span class="n">template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./README_template.md&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_text</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./README.md&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write_text</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">template</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">latest_post</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">),</span>
            <span class="n">latest_podcast_post</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">podcast_url</span><span class="p">),</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Step 5: Setup your Github Actions File</h2>

<p>I'm not the best at Github Actions. Luckily for me, this action was super
simple to setup. </p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/kjaymiller/blob/master/.github/workflows/latest_post_readme.yml">.yml file</a> I'm not going to talk about the setup of this
because most of it is prep stuff. Here's the important bit.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># in steps:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Install Feedparser &amp; Jinja2</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pip install feedparser jinja2</span>

<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Update Readme</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">python ./.github/actions/update_readme.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Basically it's installing the things I need and then running the script (I
saved the script in that folder, but you don't really have to as long as its in
your repo).</p>

<p>After that, you add some commands to update your repo and you're off to the
races.</p>

<p>I have mine setup to update on a github push in that repo, but in the future I
will probably setup the file on a schedule to also update when I push something
new (Future Post...Probably).</p>

<title>PIT Reflections: The Spiral to free Content</title>  <description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/8568b432"></iframe>

<p>Your Boy got a JOB! Next month begins my career as a developer advocate, but we don't talk about that too much. </p>

<p>I had a conversation with a friend where we talked about the race to the bottom with content creation becoming more and more free. I talk about the ups and downs of this.</p>

<h2>Transcription:</h2>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:20:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:00:20:</p>

<p>Miller here back with a reflection, this time for the 18th of August 2 20.</p>

<p>00:00:29:</p>

<p>And this is a very interesting one.</p>

<p>00:00:32:</p>

<p>This is what we're recording.</p>

<p>00:00:33:</p>

<p>Live on, Twitch.</p>

<p>00:00:35:</p>

<p>If you want to catch that, then you need to make sure following on twitch.</p>

<p>00:00:40:</p>

<p>So we got a lot to talk about.</p>

<p>00:00:42:</p>

<p>Let's just jump right into this and we're going to start with the biggest news.</p>

<p>00:00:49:</p>

<p>Yeah, I got a job.</p>

<p>00:00:55:</p>

<p>I am officially going to be working as a developer advocate for elastic search.</p>

<p>00:01:03:</p>

<p>Um, I believe the last time we talked about this, I was like, Right there.</p>

<p>00:01:08:</p>

<p>I think I had, like, one more interview left, right?</p>

<p>00:01:10:</p>

<p>Just had the final interview and had to negotiate and do all that stuff.</p>

<p>00:01:16:</p>

<p>So we are now developer advocates.</p>

<p>00:01:20:</p>

<p>And for people who have been following the journey of productivity and tech and my personal journey, you'll know that this has been a thing that I have been working towards for the last 56 years.</p>

<p>00:01:38:</p>

<p>So I want to take the second half of this conversation to talk about something that I came up in a conversation that I had with another content creator earlier today.</p>

<p>00:01:53:</p>

<p>As I'm recording this, I'm recording this on the 17 that will come out on the 18th.</p>

<p>00:01:57:</p>

<p>Uh, I was watching this person live stream, and they were talking about wanting to consolidate some of the things that they were doing and put them all under different tiers of support.</p>

<p>00:02:11:</p>

<p>Now, people that are familiar with pit know that one of you want to give me money.</p>

<p>00:02:17:</p>

<p>I'm not going to stop you.</p>

<p>00:02:19:</p>

<p>But I am terrible at asking for money.</p>

<p>00:02:23:</p>

<p>I'm terrible at providing value that I feel warrants people giving me money.</p>

<p>00:02:30:</p>

<p>That's just something that I have always struggled with presenting.</p>

<p>00:02:39:</p>

<p>However, I also feel like the things that I do are valuable.</p>

<p>00:02:47:</p>

<p>And I let people know if you want me to continue to do those things, there has to be some form of value conveyed so that I can continue to pay to do those things Now.</p>

<p>00:03:05:</p>

<p>To me, that looks like some really fun stuff that looks like me, you know, doing open mic stuff with some of my people, some of the people in the community, or just sit there and having conversations with them for hours on end or you re tweeting and showcasing some of the awesome things that they're doing.</p>

<p>00:03:27:</p>

<p>It could be getting on a stream like this and recording.</p>

<p>00:03:31:</p>

<p>You know, my podcast episodes live and doing all these things.</p>

<p>00:03:36:</p>

<p>But there was a conversation in the conversation.</p>

<p>00:03:40:</p>

<p>We talked about the idea of content creation moving ever and ever closer to where everything was expected to be free.</p>

<p>00:03:53:</p>

<p>And as much as I want Teoh complain about that, he's right.</p>

<p>00:04:02:</p>

<p>All my content available for free.</p>

<p>00:04:05:</p>

<p>I don't even my premiums show is free.</p>

<p>00:04:08:</p>

<p>Yes, you got to do something.</p>

<p>00:04:10:</p>

<p>You gotta sign up for my newsletter, which I mean Newsletter will also go out when this goes out.</p>

<p>00:04:15:</p>

<p>So there's that.</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>But if you want bonus content, you don't have to give up anything monetarily for it.</p>

<p>00:04:25:</p>

<p>And in a way, this is a good and bad thing, and I think that it's happening for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<p>00:04:39:</p>

<p>So I'm gonna outlined the reasons first, and then I'll explain why I think it's both a good and a bad thing.</p>

<p>00:04:45:</p>

<p>The reason is it's cheaper and cheaper to make content, and the demand for quality content is going down.</p>

<p>00:04:54:</p>

<p>If you look at education traditional If you go back 20 years ago, if you wanted toe learn something, you had to spend good money.</p>

<p>00:05:09:</p>

<p>And depending on what it was, you might have to pay a lot more.</p>

<p>00:05:13:</p>

<p>Programming books were like 60 70 $80 at Barnes and Noble.</p>

<p>00:05:18:</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure they still are.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>You can get an online course for 10 bucks a month.</p>

<p>00:05:27:</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>

<p>00:05:28:</p>

<p>You can get hundreds of courses for $10 a month.</p>

<p>00:05:35:</p>

<p>Why, though Well, because it's easier to mill, it's easier to say I'm going to do a thing.</p>

<p>00:05:41:</p>

<p>I'm going to follow the steps and in marketing terms, I'm gonna turkey carve content so that I'm making more and more content easier and easier with less and less effort.</p>

<p>00:05:53:</p>

<p>And here's an example of that.</p>

<p>00:05:56:</p>

<p>I did a coaching course over the weekend with a client of mine, and in that course we talked about a few things over the span of about three hours.</p>

<p>00:06:09:</p>

<p>In that time, I came out with about five different block post topics with screenshots and a video that I could go back and look at and so many other features so many other things that I could use to generate more content already had the video set up.</p>

<p>00:06:31:</p>

<p>I already had.</p>

<p>00:06:32:</p>

<p>The Screenshots already had the links and references.</p>

<p>00:06:34:</p>

<p>I already had the research.</p>

<p>00:06:37:</p>

<p>I could just turn all that stuff out like butter if I wanted to.</p>

<p>00:06:43:</p>

<p>That's what I mean as we're doing things.</p>

<p>00:06:46:</p>

<p>The things that we're doing can be reused and recycled in my talk that I'm going to be giving it pie.</p>

<p>00:06:52:</p>

<p>Gotham I quote a talk that I gave last year as the explainer for why this talk was even necessary as an explainer for why the entire platform that I created was necessary.</p>

<p>00:07:06:</p>

<p>I didn't have to do a bunch of market research.</p>

<p>00:07:08:</p>

<p>I didn't have to dio a bunch of testing, and I didn't have to pay a bunch of money to host on my code, my storage and make everything happen.</p>

<p>00:07:16:</p>

<p>Now I'm paying a little bit, but in the future, that's actually gonna be free as well.</p>

<p>00:07:21:</p>

<p>So, through all of this, I'm able Teoh really expand the scope of what I'm capable of doing for much less so.</p>

<p>00:07:37:</p>

<p>Like I said, it's easier to create content content to be created faster and it requires a lot less work and energy, and the people that are doing it at the highest level are still going to excel because of the calibre of content and the quality of content that they're putting out.</p>

<p>00:07:53:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:07:55:</p>

<p>Is this a bad thing?</p>

<p>00:07:58:</p>

<p>In short, No.</p>

<p>00:08:00:</p>

<p>No, it's not.</p>

<p>00:08:01:</p>

<p>And here's why.</p>

<p>00:08:05:</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, part of what got me hired onto elastic was a skill set that I developed over time and gave away for free.</p>

<p>00:08:18:</p>

<p>So if you look at my salary and it may be a bad way to equate the value of this, but if you go back and you look at what I've been able to get to in terms of a salary over five years, if you look at where I started, I have doubled close to doubled.</p>

<p>00:08:38:</p>

<p>Haven't double quite yet, but I'm close to doubled.</p>

<p>00:08:41:</p>

<p>What I am, what I was making when I started in the tech industry in seven years, I almost doubled what I was able to do, all because of the things that I did for free in my off time.</p>

<p>00:09:00:</p>

<p>So for me to make those things for free was a net positive in my book now, Do I feel like content should be given away for free?</p>

<p>00:09:15:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:09:17:</p>

<p>Some content?</p>

<p>00:09:17:</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of content.</p>

<p>00:09:19:</p>

<p>No, I don't think ab should be free.</p>

<p>00:09:23:</p>

<p>In general, I think that giving away an app means that you are selling something else.</p>

<p>00:09:29:</p>

<p>You're making that money back some way.</p>

<p>00:09:32:</p>

<p>Unless you're doing what you know a few of my friends have in building a thing to learn about it.</p>

<p>00:09:38:</p>

<p>In fact, most of people that I know that have built a thing just to learn how to do that thing, actually sell that thing that they made that learning until they sell it.</p>

<p>00:09:48:</p>

<p>Because they understand that there was a work that went into it.</p>

<p>00:09:50:</p>

<p>So they want to get value back for the work that they put in.</p>

<p>00:09:53:</p>

<p>That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>00:09:58:</p>

<p>Is it free for me to podcasts?</p>

<p>00:09:59:</p>

<p>No, it's not happy hosting peas.</p>

<p>00:10:03:</p>

<p>Ah, take time away from my family like I am right now.</p>

<p>00:10:06:</p>

<p>I do a lot, Teoh and pay a lot to do the things that I do streaming this.</p>

<p>00:10:19:</p>

<p>I had to buy a whole new computer last year so I could stream because when I tried streaming on my other devices.</p>

<p>00:10:27:</p>

<p>They just crashed and they shut down this whole set up that I have this microphone that I have the audio interface, everything else.</p>

<p>00:10:37:</p>

<p>This is thousands of dollars that I've invested into this.</p>

<p>00:10:41:</p>

<p>Now you would say that those air probably good investments, but they were investments nonetheless, so it doesn't make sense to me to create a thing for free.</p>

<p>00:10:54:</p>

<p>However, I knew strategically what I was doing and that I was going to get paid for it eventually.</p>

<p>00:11:01:</p>

<p>And now I can happily say, like for the last three or four years, productivity in tech podcast has paid for itself.</p>

<p>00:11:09:</p>

<p>We have people that support the show at a high enough level that I don't have to pay any money to host it.</p>

<p>00:11:17:</p>

<p>Between the work that I do outside of the client work that I pick up in all of those things, I'm effectively getting it for free.</p>

<p>00:11:31:</p>

<p>That said to the people who are making something and hoping to give it away for free and still make a living off of it.</p>

<p>00:11:41:</p>

<p>You have to know what the planets my plan was to do the bed podcast for free in hopes that one day someone would pay me to podcast for them.</p>

<p>00:11:55:</p>

<p>And like I said, I'm not there yet, But I'm hoping that soon enough that will be happening.</p>

<p>00:11:59:</p>

<p>Now I'm in a position to where that can possibly happen.</p>

<p>00:12:07:</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there that are making content for free that don't have a monetization strategy.</p>

<p>00:12:17:</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there that are doing something for free and hoping to turn it into something that they can get big enough on and make a bunch of money off of eventually.</p>

<p>00:12:31:</p>

<p>Here's what I have to say to those people.</p>

<p>00:12:35:</p>

<p>It is much easier to look at what you have.</p>

<p>00:12:42:</p>

<p>Look at the people it brings value to and ask them to support your work now, not with the promise that you will do anything outside of what you're already doing, but just for the sake of supporting your existing work.</p>

<p>00:13:05:</p>

<p>It is much easier to ask them now for support, and you'll most likely receive some form of support from those people that get value from what you're doing.</p>

<p>00:13:16:</p>

<p>It may not be a ton, but it may be a little long term listeners.</p>

<p>00:13:22:</p>

<p>The pit will know that there used to be a Facebook group that had thousands of people in it, that we're all part of the productivity and tech Facebook group.</p>

<p>00:13:31:</p>

<p>I gave up that group to start a small private community where people had to pay to get access to it.</p>

<p>00:13:41:</p>

<p>It didn't promise them any bells and whistles.</p>

<p>00:13:42:</p>

<p>All it promised them was a chat room where they could connect with me on a regular basis.</p>

<p>00:13:46:</p>

<p>And since then that community is now free again.</p>

<p>00:13:49:</p>

<p>And the only people that really talking it are the people that still give me money to support what I'm doing.</p>

<p>00:13:58:</p>

<p>The people that signed up for that there were a total of eight people, and I'm still friends with all of those eight people.</p>

<p>00:14:10:</p>

<p>Those eight people provided 800 times more revenue, more profit and on a budget that made it a lot easier for me to do podcasting, then a group of thousands of people who were listening Teoh the pope, reading the posts and liking and doing all that stuff, and it was so much easier to please those eight people than it was to create, engaging and enlightening content for 2000 people, and that's why I'm saying, Look at your existing audience, figure out how much value you're bringing to them and ask, and if they can't do it, they can't do it.</p>

<p>00:15:03:</p>

<p>But I think the reason that people are rushing to the bottom for free content is because they have to rely on a numbers game that is unfair to creators.</p>

<p>00:15:18:</p>

<p>They're having to push hundreds of thousands of people consuming their content.</p>

<p>00:15:23:</p>

<p>They have to create content instead of creating the content that they want to create in the content that they enjoy creating.</p>

<p>00:15:29:</p>

<p>They have to now make content with the thought of.</p>

<p>00:15:33:</p>

<p>Is this going to generate an audience?</p>

<p>00:15:36:</p>

<p>Is this going to generate traffic?</p>

<p>00:15:38:</p>

<p>Is this going to make what I'm doing appealing to advertisers?</p>

<p>00:15:49:</p>

<p>I don't like the direction that we're going in, and I don't want people to feel like productivity And tech is Go is helping promote that kind of business model.</p>

<p>00:16:12:</p>

<p>I said a long time ago it won't have ads on it.</p>

<p>00:16:15:</p>

<p>The podcast itself won't have, adds.</p>

<p>00:16:18:</p>

<p>The newsletter might have ads.</p>

<p>00:16:20:</p>

<p>I might give shoutouts, but I'm not gonna do ads.</p>

<p>00:16:25:</p>

<p>My website might have ads.</p>

<p>00:16:27:</p>

<p>The website.</p>

<p>00:16:28:</p>

<p>I'm sorry, However, right now I'm not trying to align myself any particular pathway that has me selling clicks for pennies.</p>

<p>00:16:42:</p>

<p>I'm not in the business of selling clicks for pennies.</p>

<p>00:16:45:</p>

<p>I'm just not.</p>

<p>00:16:46:</p>

<p>I don't have time for that.</p>

<p>00:16:47:</p>

<p>I don't have the energy for that.</p>

<p>00:16:49:</p>

<p>If I were doing a podcast with someone else, there might be a different conversation.</p>

<p>00:16:55:</p>

<p>But in regards to the pit podcast, it is not in the business of trading clicks or listens for pins.</p>

<p>00:17:06:</p>

<p>However, productivity in tech has always and will always be my playground.</p>

<p>00:17:13:</p>

<p>It will be the thing that I do for fun.</p>

<p>00:17:15:</p>

<p>It will be the thing that I do because I enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>00:17:18:</p>

<p>And I hope that over monetization of a platform that I am able to encourage, inspire and enlightened folks on a pathway to be more productive in whatever it is they're doing.</p>

<p>00:17:33:</p>

<p>That is the goal of productivity intact with the business, the podcast, the brand, all of those things.</p>

<p>00:17:41:</p>

<p>I hope that I've been doing that.</p>

<p>00:17:44:</p>

<p>If I haven't, please call me out, and I will try to course correct bunts.</p>

<p>00:17:51:</p>

<p>Just because I give this away for free doesn't mean that your information is being sold.</p>

<p>00:18:01:</p>

<p>It doesn't mean that I'm tracking you.</p>

<p>00:18:04:</p>

<p>In fact, I have aligned the podcast with organizations and companies and hosting that doesn't track.</p>

<p>00:18:15:</p>

<p>They track information for me.</p>

<p>00:18:19:</p>

<p>And while I will peak at it from time to time, that those numbers don't go anywhere, they don't go to anybody.</p>

<p>00:18:29:</p>

<p>And the people that are hosting it aren't using it.</p>

<p>00:18:31:</p>

<p>They're not selling that information.</p>

<p>00:18:33:</p>

<p>They can.</p>

<p>00:18:33:</p>

<p>It's our assess its It's like MP threes, and that's why I don't have, you know, adds auto generated into this show and all those things.</p>

<p>00:18:41:</p>

<p>And there's again nothing wrong with the people that are doing that.</p>

<p>00:18:46:</p>

<p>I am choosing not to do that.</p>

<p>00:18:49:</p>

<p>So this has been my little rant in that area.</p>

<p>00:18:52:</p>

<p>Like I said, I don't really have any particular point.</p>

<p>00:18:57:</p>

<p>I just want you also think about where content creation is going.</p>

<p>00:19:06:</p>

<p>I see a lot of people now that we're creating what's called premium content where you can't even get access to the basic level of content without paying for it.</p>

<p>00:19:14:</p>

<p>That's a very interesting model.</p>

<p>00:19:16:</p>

<p>You have to have a large audience beforehand to do that.</p>

<p>00:19:21:</p>

<p>I think it will work for some.</p>

<p>00:19:24:</p>

<p>I don't think it'll work for me, but I am excited to see that people are still trying to figure out how they can create content that is scalable monetarily but also protective of the consumer's rights.</p>

<p>00:19:47:</p>

<p>All right, so let's wrap this up.</p>

<p>00:19:49:</p>

<p>What we got coming up next next week, I have an interview with someone that I've been listening to their podcast since like Day One, they come out of the same camp is like Tom Merritt and those folks.</p>

<p>00:20:03:</p>

<p>It's not going to be a technical interview.</p>

<p>00:20:04:</p>

<p>It's gonna be a really fun conversation that I had with someone that I've been wanting to talk to you for years.</p>

<p>00:20:11:</p>

<p>So I am stoked that it finally got toe happen.</p>

<p>00:20:14:</p>

<p>I can't wait to go back and edit it, because I get to listen to it again.</p>

<p>00:20:18:</p>

<p>You know, that's that's like the best part of doing these shows is that I get to record them, some having the conversation as it's happening organically.</p>

<p>00:20:25:</p>

<p>Then I get to go back and listen to it before everyone else does, and then afterwards I gotta listen to it again just to make sure I didn't screw anything up.</p>

<p>00:20:31:</p>

<p>And every time I listen to it, every time I hear the conversation or as it's happening, I pick up on something new and I learned something new.</p>

<p>00:20:39:</p>

<p>So it's like it's super awesome to have opportunities like that coming out.</p>

<p>00:20:46:</p>

<p>So, yeah, I'm gonna like I said, I have that interview coming out next week.</p>

<p>00:20:50:</p>

<p>I am doing the last interviews for the rest of the year, this week and next week.</p>

<p>00:20:56:</p>

<p>So I get to kind of relax going into this new role where I'm only having to create content for the reflection side of things and not for the actual like, Oh, we're doing a podcast interview thing where I got to bring people in.</p>

<p>00:21:13:</p>

<p>I might do some more interviews with people if I want to, but there's no requirement to.</p>

<p>00:21:19:</p>

<p>And if I do, I'll let you know, and we'll figure it out on all those things.</p>

<p>00:21:25:</p>

<p>So that's gonna be it for this reflection and ran a little bit longer because I started rambling people watching live.</p>

<p>00:21:34:</p>

<p>Thank you for hanging out.</p>

<p>00:21:36:</p>

<p>I had to have the fan running behind me because I was sweating something terrible.</p>

<p>00:21:41:</p>

<p>But thank you to the live audience listening.</p>

<p>00:21:45:</p>

<p>If you want to be a part of that live audience, you can follow me on switch.</p>

<p>00:21:47:</p>

<p>I always announce what?</p>

<p>00:21:49:</p>

<p>I'm going live and you can follow me on Twitter.</p>

<p>00:21:54:</p>

<p>That's where I do a lot of those announcements.</p>

<p>00:21:56:</p>

<p>If you're looking at my website right now, KJ why Miller?</p>

<p>00:21:59:</p>

<p>Thank you so much for that.</p>

<p>00:22:00:</p>

<p>Of course, you can catch all the things happening for productivity and tech it productivity intact dot com You can follow them on Twitter, prod, underscore and underscore Tech And last but not least thank you to an eight year old Wally for the use of his music hustler.</p>

<p>00:22:15:</p>

<p>In spite of myself for the intro and Outro folks, I'm excited.</p>

<p>00:22:21:</p>

<p>The rest of the year is gonna be a legit.</p>

<p>00:22:23:</p>

<p>It's gonna be awesome.</p>

<p>00:22:24:</p>

<p>I cannot wait for all the things that I get to do in this new role and how that's point to benefit me as a podcaster so I can bring that value back to this show.</p>

<p>00:22:39:</p>

<p>I am stuff I'm pumped That's going to do it for this week.</p>

<p>00:22:44:</p>

<p>I hope we've been productive.</p>

<title>How I Made My Twitch Player Appear on My Site Only When I&#39;m Live</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to write this to show that the easiest answer can often elude us. </p>

<p>If I asked you to add a twitch frame to a website and make it only appear when you were live, how would you do it?</p>

<h2>Embedding the Twitch Frame</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything">documentation</a> from Twitch, I copied the example code, adjusted the width and the height<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and changed the <code>channel-id</code> to my Twitch username.</p>

<h2>Checking the Live Status</h2>

<p>After spending an hour on stream trying to build a twitch app, I opted for the more low-tech solution. </p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getPlayerState</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">currentTime</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#twitch-block&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">display</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;initial&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#twitch-block&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">display</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;None&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There were a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The javascript was easy.</li>
<li>The authentication stuff is hard to stream (in a secure way)</li>
<li>RateLimits and things</li>
<li>THE JAVASCRIPT WAS EASY</li>
</ul>

<p>The hardest part about building this listener was keeping it simple. You could add event listeners and things and you could use webhooks and all that stuff. Another option is to look at the <code>currentTime</code> value. When you are not streaming, <code>player.getPlayerState().currentTime == 0</code><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. This means that I can set  <code>display="None"</code> on the element that holds the twitch player. Allowing my website to act like the embed was never there<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Don't forget to add an amazing purple background so it looks fantastic!</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/purple-background-twitch-embed.png" alt="embed with a beautiful background" /></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Which I still a little confused on how that present in a responsive way&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-2">
<p>I don't know if this is the case if you are hosting someone sooooo... Your mileage may vary.&#160;<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-3">
<p>There could be some performance issues with this, but ultimately if there is the player would not load which means that the block wouldn't take up any space.&#160;<a href="#fnref-3" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently been doing weekly reviews with my wife (GTD addicts calm down, not that kind of review). Mostly we just cover my schedule and plan our meals for the week. This has been amazing for us as it gets us on the same page and eliminates any last minute decisions. </p>

<p>Also, I'm not always thinking about what my wife has on her schedule. So this allows me to check the <em>Family Calendar</em> and make sure that anything that will impact the family or our routine is on there. I also put our weekly meal plan in OmniFocus with the tag: <em>Dinner</em>.</p>

<title>How to Automate Form Filling with Keyboard Maestro (For Big Sur)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Working to help a friend automate some form entry I went to look back into how I had automated a similar task a few years ago with <a href="https://keyboardmastro.com">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I was surprised at how I remembered the steps to input form fields (Big props to the KM team for making it so easy to do.)</p>

<p>But when I went to test adding value to the field, I got nothing. If you're trying to automate this form filling, you may run into the same steps so hopfully this will serve as a quick guide to troubleshoot the problems you may have run into or to start automating your own form fields.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This guide uses Safari but you can use the Chrome actions to complete the same tasks.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Step 1: 🚨 Make sure Javascript can Be Ran FROM System Events 🚨</h2>

<p>Ultimately this was the issue I ran into. This setting (off by default prevents rogue applications from taking control of your browser). In most cases this is a great security measure but in our case, it breaks the Keyboard Maestro functionality.</p>

<h3>For Safari</h3>

<p>With Safari open go to <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the advanced column.</p>

<p>Check the box <em>Show Develop menu in menu bar</em></p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Show%20Develop%20Menu%20from%20MenuBar.png" alt="check the box show develop menu in menu bar" /></p>

<p>In the menu bar select the <em>Develop</em> menu and select the option <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Allow%20Javascript%20from%20Apple%20Events.png" alt="Enable Javascript from Apple Events" /></p>

<h3>For Chrome</h3>

<p>Chrome makes this a little easier. In the menu bar select <em>View</em>, then <em>Develop</em> (already visible) and select <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p>In both cases, you will see a check mark that indicates you are ready to Automate!</p>

<h2>Step 2: Find the XPath of the field you want to Enter</h2>

<p>This is where the magic happens 🧙🏾‍♂️. Finding the right field to target with information can be a challenge as websites come in many different sizes and accesssibility forms.That said you can use the tools built into Keyboard Maestro or the browser to find the correct XPath.</p>

<p>Don't worry too much about what an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath">XPath</a> is. You just need to know how to find it. </p>

<h3>Using Keyboard Maestro</h3>

<p>In Keyboard Maestro, when you select the <em>Set Safari Field to Text</em> the <em>Safari ˇ</em> will look for forms on the active tab of in your browswer and show all of the input fields available. Find the field that you want to automate with text and select it. Enter the text you wish to fill in. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Set%20Safari%20Field.png" alt="Choosing the XPath from Keyboard Maestro" /></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: There is also a checkbox version of this that works exclusively for checkboxes</strong></p>

<h3>Using Safari/Chrome</h3>

<p>If you have a lot of fields that you want need to identify you can figure out the exact text field you want to add to by right-clicking the field in your browser and selecting <em>Inspect Element</em> (<em>Inspect</em> for Chrome) to view the source code. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Inspect%20Element.png" alt="inspect element" /></p>

<p>Then in the inspector you can right click the highlighted code-block and hover over <em>copy</em> and select <em>XPath</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Copy%20XPath.png" alt="copy XPath" /></p>

<p>Repeat this step as many times as you like for each field. Finally, add a submit field.</p>

<title>January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year I made the decision to go full time analog productivity. To me this was a return to my <em>Midori Traveller's Notebook</em> and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. </p>

<p>With January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. </p>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<p>Since I've been reading [<em>The Bullet Journal Method</em>][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. </p>

<p>This time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in <em>Marie Kondo</em> style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were "essential" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. </p>

<p>With the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.</p>

<p>Another big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  </p>

<h3>What didn't go so well</h3>

<p>There is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. </p>

<p>Another failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. </p>

<h3>My thoughts going into February</h3>

<p>February is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.</p>

<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 15 Dec 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">sponsoring all my projects</a>! </p>

<h2><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> was one of the first apps that I saw that was taking advantage of iCloud sync. There are many apps like <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a>. There is also the darling <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>. </p>

<p>I noticed these subscription services were paying mostly for plain-text storage. I could get the URL, the title, and tags, but if I wanted access to the content, good luck. Even when I could store offline versions of pages, I couldn't access them via an API. I wanted to be able to integrate my bookmarking service and make it searchable with other tools. </p>

<p>Goodlinks is a bookmarking service with great simplicity, which is what I was looking for. Everything is available and stored locally via iCloud with. I recently figured out how to <a href="http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-your-browser-history/">get access to Safari history</a>.  I think I can do something similar with GoodLinks.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Goodreads.png" alt="My Goodlinks Board" /></p>

<p>Right now, I'm bookmarking web things in GoodLinks. When I feel I have enough content to release another TIFOTIR, I pull from there (instead of my head).</p>

<h2><a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula Theme</a></h2>

<p>I spend much of my time in [iTerm2]. Just because the terminal may be an <em>old- school</em> way of doing things doesn't mean I should keep my screen in the old school. [Oh-my-zsh] gives me plenty of great plugin access and themes out of the box, but I wanted a theme that was somewhat subtle that would just pop out some of the information that I should be looking for.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/iTerm%20with%20Dracula%20Theme.png" alt="My Terminal with the Dracula Theme" /></p>

<p>[Dracula] does a wonderful job not adding a lot of complexity to my terminal but emphasizes bits of data. Also they have many themes for other applications. I am also using their <a href="https://draculatheme.com/alfred">Alfred Theme</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://catvscode.hashnode.dev/what-i-learned-from-close-call-interviews">What I learned from Close Call Interviews</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/@catvscode">@catvscodes</a>)</h2>

<p>I met to Cat via Twitter. She's a wonderful UI Engineer with a ton of experience. That said, HIRE HER if you're hiring!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time not getting interviews (straight ghosted 👻). Cat's been getting so close in interviews. It hurts a lot when the you invest a lot of time into landing that job and you don't get it.</p>

<p>This was a good reminder of a few things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never, ever believe anything anyone says until the offer is in front of your face with your name on it...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if they didn't pick you, it's their loss. Don't waste time fretting about why it wasn't you or singing the hymn of the impostor on repeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a little bit of a bummer but it's a reality that we often don't think about. Thank you Cat for the perspective and I'm seriously rooting for you!</p>

<h2><a href="https://glasnt.com/blog/on-collecting-nos">On Collecting No's</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">@glasnt</a>)</h2>

<p>Funny thing happened the other day, I got a rejection email from a conference saying that my talk. This was a conference that I REALLY wanted to speak at. I had also recieved rejections to a few other conferences a couple weeks before. On top of that, I am an advocate so speaking at conferences is a bit of an expectation. </p>

<p>Recently, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">Katie</a> at a conference organizers meeting. She's absolutely wonderful and a fellow advocate. She wrote a post a while back about putting conference talk rejections into perspective.</p>

<p>My personal Favorite note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your submission was a sales pitch. Okay, look. I know. Sales people gotta sales. But, when a conferences asks “No pitches” and you throw a dozen “BUY ME NOW” submissions, yeah, you’re going to get rejected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah the funny part... Apparently, I submitted two talks to the conference and the other one was with a different account. They accepted that talk but message went to spam. Luckily I was looking for another email and found it... 😅</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/gift-subscriptions-for-kids/">10 Fun Gift Subscription Boxes for Kids</a></h2>

<p>I normally don't promote these big editorial teams, but as a dev-dad, I am always trying to get fun projects for me and the little one to play around with. We use KiwiCo and she get the 2-5 year old's box. I do plan on looking into some of the other boxes in the new year. </p>

<title>The &#34;Problem&#34; with rewriting tasks in your Bullet Journal</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked about the headache of re-writing things in my Bullet Journal. I have an interesting trick in fixing that. </p>

<h2>I do the task so I don't have to write it down more than once or twice.</h2>

<p>If I have to write it down more than twice, I must convince myself that is a task worth keeping. I do this by looking at how long a task will take. If less than 30 minutes, I do it on the spot.</p>

<p>This idea is like that of a Mitch Hedberg joke.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sit in a hotel and think of something funny. When I think of something,  I get a pen and pad and write it down. If I can't find a pen or pad, I convince myself that what I just thought of was not that funny<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often convince myself to do the thing instead of writing it down for the umpteenth-time. Alternatively, I strike it and say, "This isn't important".</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>I have been struggling to find this quoted so I have to believe that I have Mandela Effected myself.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<title>How Can White People Help Black People. What is the Real Problem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from a personal conversation I had.</p>

<p>Not to be the Subject matter black guy or anything but a couple of years of research and several years of living has taught me this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.</li>
<li>There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.</li>
<li>We can't blame "fathers not being in the homes". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.</li>
<li>White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>My thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these "Dangerous" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years</p>

<h3>How Do You Fix Number 2?</h3>

<p>Make education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.</p>

<p>As someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.</p>

<p>My chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.</p>

<p>I will put it clearly...</p>

<p><strong>HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.</strong></p>

<p>It won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>We can't pull ourselves up by our bootstraps if we can't afford boots.</em>" - Someone that at one point couldn't afford boots.</p>

<title>The Extra Effort That Sets You Apart - Ridiculous Hat</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>My guest this week is Ridiculous Hat.</p><p>Hat is a podcaster for the coin concede podcast. Their goal is to take the competitive side of the Hearthstone collectible card game more approachable for the everyday player.</p><p>I’ve been listening to Hat’s podcast for a few months and through getting to know him and the community he runs with friends and fellow players, there were two things that really impressed me:</p><ol>
<li>The podcast is produced extremely well in spite of the fact that none of the core hosts that run the podcast do that or play hearthstone full time.</li>
<li>The crew does not seem to be entirely devoted to Hearthstone and this allows them to approach the show with a non-biased critique that is valuable for any player of any game.</li>
</ol><p>In this conversation I learn a bit more about Hat’s background with audio as well as his relationship with his hobby and why he doesn’t plan to make it a full time thing.</p><p><strong><br />Connect with Hat<br /></strong><br /></p><ul>

<title>Benefits of a Family Gift Site</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently created <a href="https://millerfamilygifts.netlify.app">millerfamilygifts.netlify.app</a>.</p>

<p>Here's Why:</p>

<h2>Family asks me</h2>

<p>My family is pretty extended between the 4 sets of parental units (including inlaws) and many of their grandparents still being around. Now when they ask me what I want. I can send them a list.</p>

<h2>It's pretty easy to maintain</h2>

<p>This list is built using <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/render_engine">Render Engine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/miller-shopping-list">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>. I plan to also update it via <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a> in the future.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot but really it's the same system this site runs on (but much simpler.)</p>

<h2>Small Projects are Fun</h2>

<p>Recently, Merlin dropped some more wisdom on <a href="https://dobyfriday.com/episodes/266">DBF</a> (Maybe it was the aftershow so sorry for stolen content).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't make a database for something a spreadsheet will do...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the site contains neither, it is just some markdown files that I update and then run the script to push live (for now) I don't need anything too fancy.</p>

<p>At some point things will get more complicated but doing complicated things on simple things is much better than complicated things on complicated things.</p>

<title>Pricing People Out</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time I quoted someone out of my market. It wasn't that I didn't want to work with them. In fact I've been working on securing the client for some time.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Screen-Shot-2019-08-06-at-10.31.26-AM.png" alt="twitter exchange" /></p>

<p>My pricing wasn't me being greedy. It was me trying to be realistic with the amount of work I put into an edit and the time I had available.</p>

<p>In fact it was me trying to establish my value as a content editor.</p>

<p>I had under sold myself time and time again to get to a position where I thought I could be competitive in the market. Much of this comes from the research I had done looking at competitors and what I brought to the table with my personal touches of:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping the customer included in the process</li>
<li>openness</li>
<li>transparency</li>
</ul>

<p>To some this is something they value. These are the people that have held onto editing their projects evaluate they like the "total control" over their work. To them I am a middle of the road. I'm not someone who can do it better, I'm someone who can do it <em>close enough</em> to how they would have done it.</p>

<p>To the ones that <em>can't be bothered to do it themselves</em> I'm just the option they chose.</p>

<p>Neither one of these is the "dream" client that I've had in my mind. The person that listened to the latest [PIT Podcast] and said "wow 😮! This guy edits his own stuff and it sounds amazing!! (Although at times I know it's merely passable). He obviously loves doing this and I want him to show that same love and care on my content."</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0Ex4jlxBVvVX38xG/giphy.gif" alt="Obama" /></p>

<p>But I have something very special. I have creators that, over time, come to appreciate not just the work that I do for them but the willingness to provide feedback on how they can improve their process. People that I talk not just about podcasting or course creating but cross industry marketing strategies that allow you to grow your network but also not be disgusting about it. People that trust me to develop per customer processes and templates and share them with my clients so if they choose they could do the work themselves or (God forbid) take the work I've done and hand it to someone cheaper and have them do it for the rates I started at.</p>

<p>There's a [great video] that mentions how to come up with pricing for service work. I do believe I've reached a price point I'm comfortable charging my clients. But now I need to put the pieces in motion to start finding and landing more folks like them.</p>

<title>name change for diversityorgs.tech (Now Tech Diversity Orgs)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a post mostly for archival purposes but today I renamed the diversityorgs project to Tech Diversity Orgs and moved the domain to <a href="https://techdiversityorgs.com">https://techdiversityorgs.com</a>. The reason why is simple, cost.</p>

<p>The <em>.tech</em> domain is <strong>$50</strong> to renew and the <em>.com</em> is <strong>$15</strong>. This doesn't seem like much in the grand scheme of things but you have to remember that TDO doesn't make money. This move <strong>cuts the annual cost by about 40%</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tally:</strong>
- Server Fees: $60/year
- Domain: <strike>$50</strike> $15</p>

<p>I do see a couple opportunities to save but at the moment having a dedicated server makes this project a bit more <em>production-level</em>. In the future I could see parts of this project evolving over time.</p>

<p>Also you may find a bug or missed area. My bad just let me know on the <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/diversity-orgs-tech">github repo</a> (still under the original project name)</p>

<title>Pigeons are Scary</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Let me first say that [Questionable Content] is hands down my favorite online comic and I've been following them for more than a decade now and have viewed EVERY SINGLE STRIP.</p>

<p>Every once in a while there is a strip that speaks to me in a profound way. Monday's post did just that.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Shared-Image-2019-08-06-10-47-21.png" alt="The key point of Monday's Strip" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passion is scary, pigeons aren't.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the fact that pigeons are the rats of the sky (don't at me). There is something profound with the idea of doing things for the sake of the norm.</p>

<p>For years, the idea of PIT was to get into podcasting and scratch an itch. Every time I wanted to take things to the next level, I would let things start to fade off because the potential growth was scary.</p>

<p>I would start with so much vigor but then things would dwindle and I would make the excuse that I just wasn't interested in that thing anymore.</p>

<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/26FLaMSr33JCqbGRW/giphy.gif" alt="Lying to myself" /></p>

<p>If I were honest, it was because I was scared.</p>

<p>In fact even in PIT's rebirth it went from being a way to help developers be more productive with coaching into a pivot to content editing because the apparent <em>lack</em>of<em>demand</em> was scary.</p>

<p>My daughter, wife and I watched <em>Tangled</em> over the weekend. There is a wonderful scene where Repunzel asks a group of thugs, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTuwo_TqlhQ">Haven't you ever had a dream?</a>"</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTuwo_TqlhQ</p>

<p>I've lost many dreams due to fear. I've instead looked at the pigeons out my window and tried to convince myself that would be enough for me.</p>

<p>It's true that my current position is a dream that came from fear. Still, it is a dream. I want to help developers create wonderful content for other developers.</p>

<p>I was terrified that I wouldn't see success and now that I have a marginal bit of success, IT's EVEN MORE TERRIFYING.</p>

<p>That said if I use that excuse as a way not to run my business (my way) I will never see that dream come to life. I'm not saying I should throw caution to the wind. I just think I should check both ways and then cross the street to get to where I've been wanting to get to for the past 6 years!</p>

Tomorrow's Post will be the regular update as usual. The blog portion of the Render Engine that I'm building (Now in testing) is still a little wonky so I wanted to share this here. This post will eventually be added to the blog.</p>
