<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 28 Dec 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a smaller TIFOTIR. I've been spending a lot of time in the last few weeks on vacation playing with my kiddo this holiday season. </p>

<p>There were still a few things I've been doing more with Still</p>

<h2><a href="https://anchor.fm/sia-sarvaiya">the phobias podcast</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/anchor-generated-image-bank/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo400/9576437/9576437-1603090521699-2ca8fedcc2d0a.jpg" alt="phobias podcast" /></p>

<p>I am always looking for new podcasts to get into. Sia is creating a podcast that looks at a number of phobias (one per episode).</p>

<p>I don't believe that I have any phobias (None that are crippling that is), but it's interesting to learn about the things that have an impact on those around me.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Drawfee">Drawfee</a> (YouTube)</h2>

<p><img src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjppzfOBvPH31BtYXrwaGYkYfq1PZjTp8hcJCTo0Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj" alt="drawfee logo" /></p>

<p>This has become the night-time cool down video channel for my wife and I. This came from <em>College Dropout</em> and are now independent. The team draws concepts from their community. They are often mashups of games, popular culture and other things.</p>

<p>I like watching Drawfee because it's fun and funny. Their drawing is great but it's not hyper realistic. It's people that love drawing that are now doing this for a living and making a ton of people laugh.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CityPlannerPlaysCityBuilders">City Planner Plays City Builder</a> (YouTube)</h2>

<p><img src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni2PFVSvLUj8KSZOKUQRu4ImJ3Y-Hc45_bC7f29=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj" alt="City Planner Plays City Builders" /></p>

<p>Another industry I know nothing about and would have no idea how to learn about is city planning. Other than Sim City and some attention stealing iOS games, I've never had to plan a city.</p>

<p><em>City Planner Plays City Builders</em> is what it says it is. It's informational. The creator has to make decisions that go against their judgement and knowledge in order to make the best of the environment and budget they are given. They also get to take their knowledge and push the game to create some amazing city scapes and patterns that I would never be able to build. I encourage you to take a look.</p>

<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 15 Dec 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">sponsoring all my projects</a>! </p>

<h2><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> was one of the first apps that I saw that was taking advantage of iCloud sync. There are many apps like <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a>. There is also the darling <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>. </p>

<p>I noticed these subscription services were paying mostly for plain-text storage. I could get the URL, the title, and tags, but if I wanted access to the content, good luck. Even when I could store offline versions of pages, I couldn't access them via an API. I wanted to be able to integrate my bookmarking service and make it searchable with other tools. </p>

<p>Goodlinks is a bookmarking service with great simplicity, which is what I was looking for. Everything is available and stored locally via iCloud with. I recently figured out how to <a href="http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-your-browser-history/">get access to Safari history</a>.  I think I can do something similar with GoodLinks.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Goodreads.png" alt="My Goodlinks Board" /></p>

<p>Right now, I'm bookmarking web things in GoodLinks. When I feel I have enough content to release another TIFOTIR, I pull from there (instead of my head).</p>

<h2><a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula Theme</a></h2>

<p>I spend much of my time in [iTerm2]. Just because the terminal may be an <em>old- school</em> way of doing things doesn't mean I should keep my screen in the old school. [Oh-my-zsh] gives me plenty of great plugin access and themes out of the box, but I wanted a theme that was somewhat subtle that would just pop out some of the information that I should be looking for.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/iTerm%20with%20Dracula%20Theme.png" alt="My Terminal with the Dracula Theme" /></p>

<p>[Dracula] does a wonderful job not adding a lot of complexity to my terminal but emphasizes bits of data. Also they have many themes for other applications. I am also using their <a href="https://draculatheme.com/alfred">Alfred Theme</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://catvscode.hashnode.dev/what-i-learned-from-close-call-interviews">What I learned from Close Call Interviews</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/@catvscode">@catvscodes</a>)</h2>

<p>I met to Cat via Twitter. She's a wonderful UI Engineer with a ton of experience. That said, HIRE HER if you're hiring!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time not getting interviews (straight ghosted 👻). Cat's been getting so close in interviews. It hurts a lot when the you invest a lot of time into landing that job and you don't get it.</p>

<p>This was a good reminder of a few things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never, ever believe anything anyone says until the offer is in front of your face with your name on it...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if they didn't pick you, it's their loss. Don't waste time fretting about why it wasn't you or singing the hymn of the impostor on repeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a little bit of a bummer but it's a reality that we often don't think about. Thank you Cat for the perspective and I'm seriously rooting for you!</p>

<h2><a href="https://glasnt.com/blog/on-collecting-nos">On Collecting No's</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">@glasnt</a>)</h2>

<p>Funny thing happened the other day, I got a rejection email from a conference saying that my talk. This was a conference that I REALLY wanted to speak at. I had also recieved rejections to a few other conferences a couple weeks before. On top of that, I am an advocate so speaking at conferences is a bit of an expectation. </p>

<p>Recently, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">Katie</a> at a conference organizers meeting. She's absolutely wonderful and a fellow advocate. She wrote a post a while back about putting conference talk rejections into perspective.</p>

<p>My personal Favorite note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your submission was a sales pitch. Okay, look. I know. Sales people gotta sales. But, when a conferences asks “No pitches” and you throw a dozen “BUY ME NOW” submissions, yeah, you’re going to get rejected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah the funny part... Apparently, I submitted two talks to the conference and the other one was with a different account. They accepted that talk but message went to spam. Luckily I was looking for another email and found it... 😅</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/gift-subscriptions-for-kids/">10 Fun Gift Subscription Boxes for Kids</a></h2>

<p>I normally don't promote these big editorial teams, but as a dev-dad, I am always trying to get fun projects for me and the little one to play around with. We use KiwiCo and she get the 2-5 year old's box. I do plan on looking into some of the other boxes in the new year. </p>

<title>Getting text from websites using Keyboard Maestro</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/how-to-automate-form-filling-with-keyboard-maestro-for-big-sur">similar post</a> I showed how to input information into a browser using <a href="https://keyboardmaestro.com">Keyboard Maestro</a>. </p>

<p>In this post I want to show another integration with your browser and show you how you can get content from your browser to do whatever you want with.</p>

<p>This technique uses Javascript to return the text of an HTML element and then it can be manipulated using Keyboard Maestro.</p>

<h2>Enable Javascript from Apple Events</h2>

<p>This setting (off by default prevents rogue applications from taking control of your browser). In most cases this is a great security measure but in our case, it breaks the Keyboard Maestro functionality.</p>

<h3>For Safari</h3>

<p>With Safari open go to <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the advanced column.</p>

<p>Check the box <em>Show Develop menu in menu bar</em></p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Show%20Develop%20Menu%20from%20MenuBar.png" alt="check the box show develop menu in menu bar" /></p>

<p>In the menu bar select the <em>Develop</em> menu and select the option <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Allow%20Javascript%20from%20Apple%20Events.png" alt="Enable Javascript from Apple Events" /></p>

<h3>For Chrome</h3>

<p>Chrome makes this a little easier. In the menu bar select <em>View</em>, then <em>Develop</em> (already visible) and select <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p>In both cases, you will see a check mark that indicates you are ready to Automate!</p>

<h2>Navigate to the page you wish to get data from</h2>

<p>You can use Keyboard Maestro's <strong>New Safari/Chrome Tab with URL</strong>. If you do this make sure that you wait until the page is fully loaded or data may not be collectable. Luckily there is a <em>Wait for Safari/Chrome to Finish Loading</em> action you can use.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/New%20Tab%20with%20URL.png" alt="New Safari/Chrome Tab" /></p>

<h2>Find the element that you wish to get the text of</h2>

<p>Highlight the selected text on the page. Right Click and select <em>Inspect Element</em> (or <em>Inspect</em> for Chrome). This will open the developer console with that selected element highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/inspect%20element-squashed.png" alt="Inspect Element" />
Right click the element and hover over copy and choose the <em>Selector Path</em> (in Chrome choose <em>copy selector</em>)</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/copy%20selector-squashed.png" alt="Copy Selector" /></p>

<h2>Use the <em>querySelector</em> method and <em>innerText</em> attribute</h2>

<p>Add the <strong>Execute Javascript in Safari/Chrome</strong> action and enter the following code.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>document.querySelector(&quot;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">PASTE</span> <span class="na">YOUR</span> <span class="na">COPIED</span> <span class="na">TEXT</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;).innerText`
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>document.querySelector</code> tells the browser to find the first element that matches your passed selection. Since you highlighted the text it will give you the most unique possible selection, so the first choice should be the correct one<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This however, <code>document.querySelector</code> gives you the full HTML element. So a paragraph would be</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>`
</code></pre></div>

<p>We don't need the <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> parts. Luckily we can use the <code>innerText</code> attribute. As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText">Mozilla</a> explains it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The innerText property of the HTMLElement interface represents the "rendered" text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To test this you can paste your code into the console of your browser (a tab in the developer console.) or you can set the action to display the results. When you have the right element you can pass that information as a variable to use later in your Keyboard Maestro workflow or you can save it to your clipboard to paste into another window. </p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Get%20Text%20from%20Website/execute%20javascript-squashed.png" alt="Execute Javascript" /></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>If you do need to get another version you can use <code>querySelectorAll(&lt;Your Element&gt;)</code> and choose the index that you're looking for.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

<title>Transcriptor now Supports SRT Upload and Conversion</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I was tasked with a new transcription project.</p>

<p>The project was to create subtitles for a few videos with the intention of expanding the job to several hours of work if the work was good enough quality. While I was certain that I could figure it out, <em>Transcriptor</em> was designed for custom text templates, not the standard SRT format. So instead of doing manual conversion of these files I decided to put the work in to make <em>Transcriptor</em> support both the importing and exporting of SRT files. This meant also for the first time working with the end_times in text markers and focusing on getting timing down to the exact word. </p>

<p>While there were wonderful options to work with SRT files I knew that I would want to build my own variation of an SRT engine. This was mostly because of future plans for transcriptor which for the first time I'm putting out there. </p>

<p>You can create a <code>Job</code> object from an srt using <code>Job.from_srt()</code>. and passing in the filepath of the object.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transcriptor</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Job</span>

<span class="n">NewSRTJob</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Job</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_srt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./srt_file.srt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This give you the ability to create new objects from this job (currently a text transcription file). You also have the ability to break down the transcription word by word and by marker. This gives you the ability to apply shifts to all or some of the srt files without having to re-index the project.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">marker</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">NewSRTJob</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">markers</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">marker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_time</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span>
    <span class="n">marker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_time</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span>

<span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;shifted_srt_file.srt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NewSRTJob</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">srt</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>SRT support is avaiable on versions of <em>Transcriptor</em> since the version series of 2020.07. You can start using <em>Transcriptor</em> by installing the package from PyPI.</p>

<p><code>pip install transcriptor</code></p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently been doing weekly reviews with my wife (GTD addicts calm down, not that kind of review). Mostly we just cover my schedule and plan our meals for the week. This has been amazing for us as it gets us on the same page and eliminates any last minute decisions. </p>

<p>Also, I'm not always thinking about what my wife has on her schedule. So this allows me to check the <em>Family Calendar</em> and make sure that anything that will impact the family or our routine is on there. I also put our weekly meal plan in OmniFocus with the tag: <em>Dinner</em>.</p>

<title>Don&#39;t Ban Companies, Change the Rules</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The allegations of abuse from Tik Tok and WeChat stem from features that data made accessible by other app developers. These Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing third-party access to friend data</li>
<li>Allowing connection between users in support requests</li>
<li>Providing device and network tracking information</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes me upset that these companies are playing by the rules but getting punished for it.</p>

<p>Like Tim Cook told Congress at the latest hearing. "If you don't like how we're doing things, change the rules."</p>

<p>I look forward to the investigation that will show that there are companies all over the world that are doing the same thing with the data that Facebook and other social media companies with "Login With..." functionality.</p>

<h2>My Suggested Action</h2>

<p><strong>Make it illegal for companies to sell your data to third-parties</strong></p>

<p>I understand that network and location-based data is pushing current app innovation. It allows for things like Uber and Yelp to work. I do think that this information should not be available outside of the company.</p>

<h2>Why Won't They Do This?</h2>

<p>This will make it possible to surface ads based on information without selling that information.</p>

<p>It also creates a level of protection from our government<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Our information would only pass to surveillance organizations from companies with a court order.</p>

<p><strong>That is why this would never happen.</strong> </p>

<p>Governments are trying to pass laws forcing backdoors into their encryption. No government wants to give up the right to spy on folks. </p>

<p>In Short, America wants to spy on you. They just don't want others to do the same. 🙃</p>

<title>How Can White People Help Black People. What is the Real Problem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from a personal conversation I had.</p>

<p>Not to be the Subject matter black guy or anything but a couple of years of research and several years of living has taught me this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.</li>
<li>There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.</li>
<li>We can't blame "fathers not being in the homes". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.</li>
<li>White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>My thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these "Dangerous" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years</p>

<h3>How Do You Fix Number 2?</h3>

<p>Make education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.</p>

<p>As someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.</p>

<p>My chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.</p>

<p>I will put it clearly...</p>

<p><strong>HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.</strong></p>

<p>It won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).</p>

<title>PIT Podcast: How Developer Advocacy is Changing with Joe Karlsson</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world of Developer Advocacy has been changing and Joe Karlsson is at the front of that movement. Moving discussions from the hallway track to Twitter, Twitch, and Tik Tok, hear how this Developer 🥑 is connecting with developers.</p>

<h2>Transcription:</h2>

<p>00:00:16:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:18:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>Miller here, back again with the Productivity in Tech.</p>

<p>00:00:22:</p>

<p>Podcast.</p>

<p>00:00:23:</p>

<p>This is the show where I sit down with somebody in the tech space that is killing it and doing absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>00:00:30:</p>

<p>And we try to figure out, like the nugget, the little thing, that it is like the key to their not success but the key to their day to day sustainability and like maintaining that high level of excellence.</p>

<p>00:00:49:</p>

<p>And this week is like every other week I have another great guest for you coming from Minnesota.</p>

<p>00:00:57:</p>

<p>00:01:02:</p>

<p>Didn't know.</p>

<p>00:01:04:</p>

<p>Thes developer advocate for mongo db.</p>

<p>00:01:09:</p>

<p>00:01:13:</p>

<p>The only joke.</p>

<p>We we actually met through a mutual friend of ours shot out to April.</p>

<p>00:01:33:</p>

<p>Uh, I know you're listening because you you send me a DEA or an email every time something.</p>

<p>00:01:39:</p>

<p>So Hey, what's up?</p>

<p>00:01:41:</p>

<p>But they keep doing that, by the way.</p>

<p>00:01:54:</p>

<p>We can talk about that a little bit later.</p>

<p>00:01:56:</p>

<p>I don't personally, but mongo DB does help people do it.</p>

<p>00:02:00:</p>

<p>That's cool.</p>

<p>00:02:01:</p>

<p>That's cool.</p>

<p>00:02:02:</p>

<p>00:02:06:</p>

<p>So I was going to do everything that I could to talk to you longer.</p>

<p>00:02:09:</p>

<p>So I just content coming onto a podcast.</p>

<p>00:02:13:</p>

<p>How does it feel?</p>

<p>00:02:15:</p>

<p>Oh, great.</p>

<p>00:02:16:</p>

<p>I love women apart.</p>

<p>00:02:16:</p>

<p>Guys so fun.</p>

<p>00:02:17:</p>

<p>It's like, uh, yeah, this is so great.</p>

<p>00:02:20:</p>

<p>Yeah, I love it to you like let's trapped like great.</p>

<p>00:02:23:</p>

<p>Let's just do the chat on my podcast.</p>

<p>00:02:27:</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>00:02:28:</p>

<p>I'm on board this.</p>

<p>00:02:29:</p>

<p>Do its we've never met.</p>

<p>00:02:31:</p>

<p>Let's share everything that we dio to the recording it for Everybody cools.</p>

<p>00:02:36:</p>

<p>Yes, let's do that since I did you love it.</p>

<p>00:02:39:</p>

<p>This was speaking of what you do.</p>

<p>00:02:40:</p>

<p>Let's let's jump into that.</p>

<p>00:02:42:</p>

<p>What is what is a day in the life of a Dev Avocado for mongo DB.</p>

<p>00:02:47:</p>

<p>It's, like, different for everyone.</p>

<p>00:02:48:</p>

<p>And I'm sure you've talked to 10 of Dev advocates to for, um I'm only off totally.</p>

<p>00:02:55:</p>

<p>Yeah, and like I've done, I've been technically for, like, large e commerce sites.</p>

<p>00:03:00:</p>

<p>Um, and this is my first time doing developer advocacy, And I've been doing for about a year now full time.</p>

<p>00:03:07:</p>

<p>Um, and it's different.</p>

<p>00:03:09:</p>

<p>Okay, so I want to paint a picture about, like, what I do to kind of accept the pits.</p>

<p>00:03:13:</p>

<p>Don't like the tone a little bit.</p>

<p>00:03:15:</p>

<p>And so I've been working about dive, like all of us working remote since Covad lockdowns happening.</p>

<p>00:03:20:</p>

<p>But I've been doing it since the beginning.</p>

<p>00:03:22:</p>

<p>It's like a remote, first kind of tick position.</p>

<p>00:03:25:</p>

<p>Um, yeah.</p>

<p>00:03:26:</p>

<p>So I'm like, home alone a lot, if you like, wildly oscillates between, like being alone and not talking anyone for weeks on end.</p>

<p>00:03:33:</p>

<p>And then like going to a conference or speaking virtually and like, having lots and lots of conversations all at once.</p>

<p>00:03:39:</p>

<p>Um, and I feel like recently too.</p>

<p>00:03:42:</p>

<p>People don't know you're listening to this to like, I've been posting a lot of tic tac videos recently and like that's been weirdly shaping my what?</p>

<p>00:03:54:</p>

<p>I've been doing the data date of my life a lot, which is so weird.</p>

<p>00:03:57:</p>

<p>I felt so stupid saying that I feel so stupid because it's I mean, I don't really do that dance that make, like, NJ.</p>

<p>00:04:03:</p>

<p>You've seen a couple of videos.</p>

<p>00:04:04:</p>

<p>They're just, like, fine trying look like fun programming jokes, Um, but stuff I feel horribly anxious about, um and I tried to, like, put that on the internet.</p>

<p>00:04:14:</p>

<p>Um, but I know what the date My day today?</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>00:04:18:</p>

<p>I'm on social media lot.</p>

<p>00:04:19:</p>

<p>I do programming as much that possibly can.</p>

<p>00:04:21:</p>

<p>I do twits trimming every Friday and a mongo db twitch channel.</p>

<p>00:04:25:</p>

<p>Um, and I speak it like maybe 12 maybe three conferences a week.</p>

<p>00:04:30:</p>

<p>She's and then that you're trying to get podcast.</p>

<p>00:04:33:</p>

<p>It's been weird.</p>

<p>00:04:33:</p>

<p>And like Kobe has been a game changer to like, Ah, I feel like I don't know, It's so it's so I'm agency like like my day to day goes here.</p>

<p>00:04:43:</p>

<p>But obviously I was traveling to conferences a lot, and if you like I've been like everything is moving online and trying to understand what online space looks like for us.</p>

<p>00:04:53:</p>

<p>And I think that that's like I am.</p>

<p>00:04:56:</p>

<p>I don't think we're gonna be like, going back to like what we had before and trying to figure out with how everyone's gonna learning and growing sharing without in person conferences.</p>

<p>00:05:07:</p>

<p>I don't know when we get those really long and winded.</p>

<p>00:05:10:</p>

<p>And I don't think I answered your question all but denies.</p>

<p>00:05:13:</p>

<p>Parade is so fun.</p>

<p>00:05:14:</p>

<p>Thank you for asking s So I will say the one thing you talked about, Like just kind of learning.</p>

<p>00:05:23:</p>

<p>I I will tell you the first, and this doesn't affect you in any way.</p>

<p>00:05:28:</p>

<p>I guess this is me.</p>

<p>00:05:29:</p>

<p>I'm not bragging or something.</p>

<p>00:05:30:</p>

<p>Um, I love Yeah, the first database architecture that I ever used in like actual, like live setting was mongo.</p>

<p>00:05:40:</p>

<p>So my manga devi was I like I am on record saying I hate, like, weird like sequel.</p>

<p>00:05:51:</p>

<p>Tire likes design like I want something that I can read.</p>

<p>00:05:55:</p>

<p>I want something that I can like, just dive into and be like, That's what I need.</p>

<p>00:05:59:</p>

<p>Give me that and not have to think about insane commands on and as totally uses python like I became well versed in pie mongo and and just just jumping into that world early.</p>

<p>00:06:15:</p>

<p>And I could tell that, like, even from the jump like Mongo, DB has always had this community first kind of approach where it's like, Hey, look, here's this thing that you can get for free with no support that also has this gigantic like documentation library that has, like, ah, lot of communities stuff a lot of community involvement or you can pay us and get access to all of the same things.</p>

<p>00:06:42:</p>

<p>But then, if you need to call us, you can kind also just do that Totally.</p>

<p>00:06:46:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly what we love here and that you like, got it among you to be first.</p>

<p>00:06:49:</p>

<p>And I think that's a super common experience to is like, Yeah, I think just like the database model makes more sense with, like, programmer, like we're saving things as objects anyways, like saving it as an object makes so much sense.</p>

<p>00:07:01:</p>

<p>Yeah, especially when you're first getting the programming and think that that, like, yeah, I understand normalisation of treat it like legacy databases of soberly so hard I'm gonna tow I know the guy who does the development for the pie Mongo driver.</p>

<p>00:07:15:</p>

<p>I'm a to tell him how much you you flip work with stuff, too, if he's awesome.</p>

<p>00:07:18:</p>

<p>Um, but, uh, yeah, we'll have that.</p>

<p>00:07:22:</p>

<p>Like, I feel like we're I don't know.</p>

<p>00:07:27:</p>

<p>I think we're trying to, like listen to developers more and more and more.</p>

<p>00:07:31:</p>

<p>And I think you're right.</p>

<p>00:07:31:</p>

<p>We've had this, like reputation for being like, very developer friendly.</p>

<p>00:07:36:</p>

<p>I think that we're we're trying to be, like, better than anyone else habits, you know?</p>

<p>00:07:39:</p>

<p>I mean, I think I don't know.</p>

<p>00:07:42:</p>

<p>It's it's hard.</p>

<p>00:07:43:</p>

<p>There's like dopers were like a fickle species were you know, we, uh, love new shiny things were, you know, were there's always new stuff coming out.</p>

<p>00:07:52:</p>

<p>You know, you can't you can't sell something that developed, doesn't want it doesn't work, right.</p>

<p>00:07:57:</p>

<p>Like it has to be like organically something helpers are one actually used, um, which is so important?</p>

<p>00:08:03:</p>

<p>Well, it was awesome.</p>

<p>00:08:05:</p>

<p>I think the thing with that, though, is your developers are starting to change, I think, as fewer and fewer developers air coming out of like M i t.</p>

<p>00:08:17:</p>

<p>And Caltech with a knocking a master's in computer science.</p>

<p>00:08:21:</p>

<p>And now it's more like, Hey, I went to this coding boot camp because I was tired of being a bartender on, and that attitude shift has, in my opinion, been great because yes, I'm coming from a position of like college dropout turned military.</p>

<p>00:08:37:</p>

<p>Better in turned like I program to solve the problems in my day to day job, and now it's like I'm ready to make that transition after, like, a decade of doing that to being like, Okay, I can call myself professional developer type.</p>

<p>00:08:55:</p>

<p>What does that look like for me?</p>

<p>00:08:56:</p>

<p>What is the intersection between managing communities and talking and getting people on shows to ask these questions and then also writing code from time to time, which I try to do every day?</p>

<p>00:09:07:</p>

<p>But it's hard.</p>

<p>00:09:09:</p>

<p>Even developers don't write code every day.</p>

<p>00:09:11:</p>

<p>It's hard.</p>

<p>00:09:11:</p>

<p>Yeah, it's hard to do every day, so yeah, and I think one of the things that you've done really well is you are meeting the group of people where they are like you are, and I think a lot of developer advocates now arm or more like not talking in a boardroom.</p>

<p>00:09:31:</p>

<p>But talking at, like from a bar stool or talking from, you know, outside it, like in the hallway track of ah, conference.</p>

<p>00:09:40:</p>

<p>And now, like talking on Twitter and take talking.</p>

<p>00:09:44:</p>

<p>And now it's which is even becoming a bigger thing where these conversations aren't being had in the quote unquote professional areas.</p>

<p>00:09:51:</p>

<p>You're making these completely like personal like curated, feed algorithmic like hallways, where you can talk tech with the people who are seeking toe.</p>

<p>00:10:05:</p>

<p>Learn from the folks like what you're doing, I was told.</p>

<p>00:10:08:</p>

<p>I told agree, and I think you nailed it, too.</p>

<p>00:10:10:</p>

<p>Like I think.</p>

<p>00:10:11:</p>

<p>Traditionally, I think that's a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>00:10:13:</p>

<p>Like people go in and go like, Yeah, I suit up and go talk to a CTO of a company and try to explain to him for the sales deck of why it works and I love it.</p>

<p>00:10:23:</p>

<p>I feel the same way to click.</p>

<p>00:10:25:</p>

<p>So I was.</p>

<p>00:10:26:</p>

<p>I was the technical instructor at a dual boot camp in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>

<p>00:10:29:</p>

<p>So, like, I have, like a really stop spot.</p>

<p>00:10:31:</p>

<p>My heart flick developers.</p>

<p>00:10:32:</p>

<p>I think that was awesome.</p>

<p>00:10:33:</p>

<p>No, like seeing people like jump in.</p>

<p>00:10:35:</p>

<p>Um, I think a lot of people like it's sexy and cool to, like, be talking about the, um, like, the latest greatest things are advanced use cases for mongo db.</p>

<p>00:10:45:</p>

<p>But, like, the thing is, 99% of users don't really care about that.</p>

<p>00:10:49:</p>

<p>Like, most people just want to know, Like, how do I put data in and get it out?</p>

<p>00:10:53:</p>

<p>You know what I mean?</p>

<p>00:10:53:</p>

<p>Or like, how do we get started?</p>

<p>00:10:55:</p>

<p>Or like, how do I want to feel like I'm listening to?</p>

<p>00:10:58:</p>

<p>You know what I mean?</p>

<p>00:10:58:</p>

<p>Or like, I'm gonna be welcome here.</p>

<p>00:11:01:</p>

<p>I think I don't know it.</p>

<p>00:11:04:</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of dope, Ravic, see is like, still kind of starting with that.</p>

<p>00:11:08:</p>

<p>I get the appeal of it, too, because I I want to be known as, like, the smartest guy about this thing.</p>

<p>00:11:14:</p>

<p>But no one really cares about that stuff.</p>

<p>00:11:16:</p>

<p>No one cares who cares or find, like, try to tell you about this advance use case like, but like, no one's there yet.</p>

<p>00:11:21:</p>

<p>Like that.</p>

<p>00:11:22:</p>

<p>Just, like doesn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>00:11:24:</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>00:11:24:</p>

<p>I think it in, like for this stuff I'm doing to.</p>

<p>00:11:27:</p>

<p>I won't be making things that like I wish I had and I was learning program, you know?</p>

<p>00:11:32:</p>

<p>I mean, like, I don't want to read a book or like, I don't know, I can't read I just getting but e just like Is It is a advanced techno mumbo jumbo of boring And I felt like I was like, I felt stupid reading It's and I felt defeated.</p>

<p>00:11:49:</p>

<p>Um, I just wanted to feel like, listen to and heard and, like, encouraged, like, keep learning even though it's hard, you know?</p>

<p>00:11:55:</p>

<p>I mean, absolutely.</p>

<p>00:11:57:</p>

<p>And I think that that's like some of the videos that you've put out on tech talk really do show that, like the junior developer releasing his first commit.</p>

<p>00:12:06:</p>

<p>It's kind of like OK, I could get fired right now.</p>

<p>00:12:11:</p>

<p>I mean, that's really that's what got me into the idea of productivity as a person who works in the tech space was lying coming from a military background when you're like I can't get fired, Yeah, like it's not here for me to die than to get fired in the military.</p>

<p>00:12:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>00:12:31:</p>

<p>Then going to a position where it's like, OK, they've given me zero instruction.</p>

<p>00:12:36:</p>

<p>All I have are like my job.</p>

<p>00:12:39:</p>

<p>Describe right.</p>

<p>00:12:40:</p>

<p>If you mess with the lending rules, you're gone.</p>

<p>00:12:42:</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>00:12:43:</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>00:12:43:</p>

<p>And, yeah, just coming into like this weird.</p>

<p>00:12:46:</p>

<p>Like, how do I How do I jump over that hill and even even wanting to get into a new career like now again, When you have someone that's like a bartender, it's like, Okay, the worst thing that I can do is give someone a really bad drink.</p>

<p>00:12:58:</p>

<p>Yeah, Or maybe just let somebody jump across the barn, My bartender for an hour.</p>

<p>00:13:02:</p>

<p>But this is surely bad, too.</p>

<p>00:13:04:</p>

<p>But that's true.</p>

<p>00:13:05:</p>

<p>That's true.</p>

<p>00:13:05:</p>

<p>It's frowned upon, but yeah, but it's a vandal world.</p>

<p>00:13:09:</p>

<p>It's fine.</p>

<p>00:13:09:</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>00:13:10:</p>

<p>And now it's like if you're working at, like, one of these, like Fang companies or our company that is dealing with databases.</p>

<p>00:13:18:</p>

<p>You know, people store important stuff in databases when data leaks, gets exudes data.</p>

<p>00:13:25:</p>

<p>Yeah, employees and I sit there and think about like, ah, a few weeks back from recording this, there was like the big T mobile like incident, and it where someone was saying like, Oh, yeah, someone like released on, uh, committed something and it wasn't ready, and it like crash the system and I was like, Ooh, that's a bad day.</p>

<p>00:13:44:</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, it just turned out that, like a couple of low bouncers like failed is a coldly exactly or someone like published a semi colon wrong and I config file or something.</p>

<p>00:13:56:</p>

<p>It exactly crash the load balancer.</p>

<p>00:13:59:</p>

<p>Yeah, and like I've crashed a couple sites, I haven't crashed anything huge.</p>

<p>00:14:03:</p>

<p>Um, and it's OK, Yeah, it's okay, but it doesn't feel OK And even, like even thinking back in the times of crashed production sites, I like, I like cringe, and I hate myself and, like, brings definitely like it's like it's hard to think about.</p>

<p>00:14:17:</p>

<p>It still hurts, you know?</p>

<p>00:14:18:</p>

<p>Um, I don't know.</p>

<p>00:14:20:</p>

<p>And I feel like we just like, is an industry like greater forgiveness for a junior.</p>

<p>00:14:23:</p>

<p>Developers like ourselves from that stuff.</p>

<p>00:14:25:</p>

<p>Um, of course, like crashing productions operate, you want to do it.</p>

<p>00:14:30:</p>

<p>If you do it twice.</p>

<p>00:14:31:</p>

<p>Probably bad.</p>

<p>00:14:33:</p>

<p>That's bad.</p>

<p>00:14:33:</p>

<p>You probably don't do the same thing twice your master privileges about what had been revoked exactly.</p>

<p>00:14:38:</p>

<p>Yeah, you probably like It's like maybe should rethink things at that point, but it like once or like messing things up eso like specifically to with that, Like so I just published a tick talk About, Like how, Like I remember, I was just like, thinking back about, like my first commit like, professional commit with a team of senior engineers reviewing my code like I'm afraid it was.</p>

<p>00:14:59:</p>

<p>And then even like as a boot camp instructor, like seeing my students met the PR's for review and, like just you can just feel the anxiety.</p>

<p>00:15:07:</p>

<p>You know, there's like a lot of anxiety about it.</p>

<p>00:15:09:</p>

<p>I A I just really In general, I think we just need more empathy in our industry, not me.</p>

<p>00:15:15:</p>

<p>And I just I think we just have, like, a lot of its words.</p>

<p>00:15:20:</p>

<p>It's scary Field, and I think you're feeling of Fear.</p>

<p>00:15:23:</p>

<p>Two.</p>

<p>00:15:24:</p>

<p>It's like everyone every feels that in that sex that's sex that's actually do that ourselves.</p>

<p>00:15:30:</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>00:15:31:</p>

<p>I feel like for the longest time developers, and I would even say like developer advocates like it was almost like that stereotypical cinematic prison mentality of like All right, I just jumped in.</p>

<p>00:15:45:</p>

<p>I gotta find the biggest and baddest person in the room and like clock.</p>

<p>00:15:48:</p>

<p>Yeah, just take down.</p>

<p>00:15:51:</p>

<p>I feel like that was when I first got in detect That was like me.</p>

<p>00:15:56:</p>

<p>Like Okay, what's the biggest problem that our company has right now?</p>

<p>00:15:59:</p>

<p>And I'm gonna solve it like, Yeah, I had minutes just to show that I'm the badass in the area.</p>

<p>00:16:04:</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, it was like you just brought the entire network down like, yeah, why minded types that leads to try Exactly.</p>

<p>00:16:15:</p>

<p>I think that there's something about advocating for all levels of development, which is which is something that, you know, we've been preaching the good word of Mongo, You know, this last 20 minutes.</p>

<p>00:16:28:</p>

<p>But yeah, more than anything, I think the attitude of I would say, like the postmodern developer advocate, is one that is like, Hey, look, at the end of the day, it's the people that air righting the code that are going to be making the biggest of these decisions because if they're using a tool that they don't like, it's it's gonna release and bad quality.</p>

<p>00:16:56:</p>

<p>So now, instead of talking to the CTO about how something can, you know, be good for their our ally and reduce.</p>

<p>00:17:05:</p>

<p>It'll increase you to reduce your workload by like, 80%.</p>

<p>00:17:09:</p>

<p>It's like you just say you were gonna fire, like, eight out of 10 people in the room that that's not what people want to hear.</p>

<p>00:17:16:</p>

<p>Uh, and instead, you're just like, Hey, look, I get it.</p>

<p>00:17:20:</p>

<p>Being a developer is hard.</p>

<p>00:17:23:</p>

<p>The tool is designed to make it a little bit easier.</p>

<p>00:17:25:</p>

<p>And I'm gonna show you how Yeah, and totally no.</p>

<p>00:17:29:</p>

<p>And I'm not gonna waste your time because I'm doing it on Twitch or I'm doing it on like a YouTube video.</p>

<p>00:17:34:</p>

<p>That way, if you can tell from like five minutes in that, it's not for you.</p>

<p>00:17:38:</p>

<p>You know you got to do is close the tab.</p>

<p>00:17:40:</p>

<p>You don't have to, like, sit there awkwardly in the boardroom like, uh oh.</p>

<p>00:17:45:</p>

<p>Told Wade, sit there like a conference and be like All right, well, this guy has a keynote.</p>

<p>00:17:49:</p>

<p>So let me check my email real quick.</p>

<p>00:17:53:</p>

<p>Yeah, No, absolutely.</p>

<p>00:17:55:</p>

<p>Usually right in, like there's a 1,000,000 different databases up there.</p>

<p>00:17:58:</p>

<p>There's a 1,000,000 different Web apple.</p>

<p>00:18:00:</p>

<p>There is a little different frame frameworks you could possibly use.</p>

<p>00:18:02:</p>

<p>It's like and I do the whole time to like, I'll spend like something a pop up on hacker news or read it.</p>

<p>00:18:08:</p>

<p>I'll spend, like, 10 seconds looking at it and then all the side, whether I want it like if it's worth my time.</p>

<p>00:18:13:</p>

<p>But it was like, J your nights Time is super valuable.</p>

<p>00:18:17:</p>

<p>I might go and, like I'm not going to spend my time frantically learning every new shining he's object that comes out like that's That's not sustainable or like even that's a terrible idea for just like our time, you know?</p>

<p>00:18:29:</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>00:18:31:</p>

<p>E Think you and I would be like, picky about what were learning and like, making sure it's worth of time both, like for a career should be even just like for fun, like I'm not gonna learn something that's, like, sucks to use and boring and buggy, and it's doesn't do anything for me, you know?</p>

<p>00:18:46:</p>

<p>I mean, I'm not spending things like actually helpful I want to use.</p>

<p>00:18:51:</p>

<p>And even with that, like you can see, like the stuff, the stuff that we have to use this stuff that we're like Ari Well, I mean, our system runs on a W s so right.</p>

<p>00:19:02:</p>

<p>Like I have to know how boto three works as a python developer working in AWS.</p>

<p>00:19:08:</p>

<p>I have to at least have an idea of that structure.</p>

<p>00:19:13:</p>

<p>No, I I mean, one of the things that I do for like, my side business that is productivity in tech is I do transcriptions for podcasters, for content creators and like all that stuff and well, I think that that's awesome.</p>

<p>00:19:28:</p>

<p>They're people that are just like, yeah, I don't want to give Amazon my money and it's like, Okay, I totally respect that.</p>

<p>00:19:35:</p>

<p>However, like now I have to go learn she see us and then I or I have to go learn like IBM Watson, which nobody wants to do, O r.</p>

<p>00:19:45:</p>

<p>I have to, like, sign up and give half of the money that I'm making toe like some third party that down the road is literally just using aws.</p>

<p>00:19:54:</p>

<p>So in my mind, I'm like now I have to learn three different schemers Teoh do the exact same thing because one person doesn't want to use the architecture and there perfectly validated for that.</p>

<p>00:20:07:</p>

<p>However, the only thing that I can do on my end is say, Well, where is the common denominator?</p>

<p>00:20:13:</p>

<p>You know, when it comes to like bringing it back to, like, database stuff?</p>

<p>00:20:17:</p>

<p>One of the things I love in Python a sequel Alchemy because it's it's designed to be the what are you using using Post Press.</p>

<p>00:20:24:</p>

<p>Okay, we got that Using that's equal.</p>

<p>00:20:26:</p>

<p>Okay, we got that.</p>

<p>00:20:27:</p>

<p>Yeah, unlike in the process of like, trying to build that for transcription tools because I'm tired of having to remember what scheme I'm in and like, Okay, how do I How do I fetch alternatives for GCS versus AWS?</p>

<p>00:20:42:</p>

<p>And I know for a lot of people, they're like, I don't know what that means, but it's one of those things were like, You get so frustrated and just fighting with the tools that you're just like if someone came to me and was like, Hey, we understand that your tool suck.</p>

<p>00:20:56:</p>

<p>Here's a way that you can use this and not wanna pull.</p>

<p>00:21:00:</p>

<p>You know, your luxurious locks out in a single day.</p>

<p>00:21:04:</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm just, like, sign me up.</p>

<p>00:21:06:</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p>00:21:08:</p>

<p>I will do that.</p>

<p>00:21:09:</p>

<p>You nailed it like I think, a part that a lot of people don't look at, especially with like cloud architecture like we're looking at like like is like developer time and, like our time tends to be the most expensive part of any project these days, like infrastructure in like the tools or uses fractional costs to our time.</p>

<p>00:21:29:</p>

<p>And I think it's developers like we don't I don't know.</p>

<p>00:21:31:</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of times and companies like our time is not respected by managers and the like.</p>

<p>00:21:37:</p>

<p>Product leads to Flake, but I think it's developers.</p>

<p>00:21:40:</p>

<p>We consider that I think we need to be advocating for a sells for, to use tools that, like makes sense and I respect our time.</p>

<p>00:21:46:</p>

<p>You know, we're like we could get done quickly.</p>

<p>00:21:48:</p>

<p>We're just easy to use and agree.</p>

<p>00:21:50:</p>

<p>Like if you have to use something if you have to learn three new schemes and bringing products to get a thing done like okay, that's okay.</p>

<p>00:21:56:</p>

<p>But like, I don't love that you're looking at like weighing the pros and cons of using things that you're already already know to use or like, easier to you know, I mean, I think that's important.</p>

<p>00:22:07:</p>

<p>Well, I think I deserve it I think it's good that there's options now, which is is the best part.</p>

<p>00:22:14:</p>

<p>But I think in that advocates should be listening to the user.</p>

<p>00:22:24:</p>

<p>I think I know.</p>

<p>00:22:25:</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>00:22:26:</p>

<p>Why did you send this?</p>

<p>00:22:28:</p>

<p>Maybe it was.</p>

<p>00:22:28:</p>

<p>I'm jumping on Twitter now because I'm a horrible podcaster.</p>

<p>00:22:31:</p>

<p>Um, no, that's great.</p>

<p>00:22:33:</p>

<p>Joe Rogan, that sequoia dozens that I'm sooner, Right?</p>

<p>00:22:39:</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>00:22:40:</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>00:22:41:</p>

<p>I think there was, Ah, blawg posts that you you responded to on Twitter earlier today.</p>

<p>00:22:47:</p>

<p>That was our early in last couple days, I guess talking about the idea of, like, look, customers don't care about that cool trick that you did to make your code work because I care about, like, the efficiency of your They They kind of care about the efficiency and more about the performance.</p>

<p>00:23:03:</p>

<p>You care about how clean your code is elegant.</p>

<p>00:23:06:</p>

<p>Your solution Now, abstract er code was all the air out is doesn't solve my problem in the end of the day.</p>

<p>00:23:13:</p>

<p>Like that's what's importantly.</p>

<p>00:23:14:</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>00:23:14:</p>

<p>Hey, can I can I use this?</p>

<p>00:23:16:</p>

<p>Doesn't solve my problem.</p>

<p>00:23:18:</p>

<p>Okay, Cool.</p>

<p>00:23:18:</p>

<p>Sign me up and I feel like more and more advocates are starting to understand that more than anything, they're starting to actually try to collect those problem points.</p>

<p>00:23:30:</p>

<p>They're like, OK, this was working for you up until this point.</p>

<p>00:23:36:</p>

<p>Yeah, What did it like?</p>

<p>00:23:38:</p>

<p>How did it fail?</p>

<p>00:23:40:</p>

<p>How can you improve it?</p>

<p>00:23:41:</p>

<p>What can we do to make this better?</p>

<p>00:23:43:</p>

<p>And how can I keep in touch with you so that when we do fix it, you'll be the first person to know, Like I feel like developer advocates are now.</p>

<p>00:23:52:</p>

<p>And this is someone who is not yet a developer advocate.</p>

<p>00:23:55:</p>

<p>This is something that's going to get into that space.</p>

<p>00:23:57:</p>

<p>Yeah, I feel like it is our role to almost be like developer slash sales person slash marketer slash customer service, like the that person that can figure out where I'm at on that path and then send them in the right direction.</p>

<p>00:24:13:</p>

<p>I think that's one of the things that you're able to do so well being able to be on social media, you are being ableto advocate for people who are, uh, just really genuinely smart.</p>

<p>00:24:26:</p>

<p>People now are trying to break into the industry, but then also being able to jump in and say this is a feeling this feeling is very legitimate.</p>

<p>00:24:36:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>00:24:37:</p>

<p>We know Teoh not listen to us.</p>

<p>00:24:40:</p>

<p>We need to look Zack Pickett seriously, like Mongo.</p>

<p>00:24:43:</p>

<p>To be is like are like we're a little bit different.</p>

<p>00:24:46:</p>

<p>A lot of companies like our customers are developers.</p>

<p>00:24:50:</p>

<p>I think I've worked for companies where my customers are people purchasing a thing from our sites or using you know, to me it's like more traditional customers.</p>

<p>00:24:58:</p>

<p>But you have to listen And I think a lot since I see that I see this really big thing cos they're just like they don't listen.</p>

<p>00:25:05:</p>

<p>They're like, This is the way we're doing it.</p>

<p>00:25:07:</p>

<p>Get on board or or relieve about Yeah, you know, I mean, it feels more just like you were going Screw you.</p>

<p>00:25:15:</p>

<p>Come along if you want.</p>

<p>00:25:16:</p>

<p>You know, I mean, really, though even open source list stuff.</p>

<p>00:25:18:</p>

<p>But like they don't they're not reading your issues or submitting.</p>

<p>00:25:22:</p>

<p>They're not like reading suggestions.</p>

<p>00:25:23:</p>

<p>It's just like we're doing things we want to do.</p>

<p>00:25:25:</p>

<p>Deal.</p>

<p>00:25:27:</p>

<p>And that's a great idea, especially if you're like making a thing for a goal for community like, how can you do that in that?</p>

<p>00:25:32:</p>

<p>Listen to offers.</p>

<p>00:25:34:</p>

<p>And the other thing I want to touch on to is you talked about like how we should be listening and so in.</p>

<p>00:25:39:</p>

<p>Like, I used to see the old name developer evangelism, and I couldn't I don't like that name.</p>

<p>00:25:44:</p>

<p>Say, I imagine that like a preacher in front of ah, congregation preaching a products, it's trying to sell it without listening.</p>

<p>00:25:51:</p>

<p>You're just presenting definitely as a developer advocate.</p>

<p>00:25:55:</p>

<p>I'm advocating for you.</p>

<p>00:25:56:</p>

<p>The developer community internally as well is like So I'm like the middle person like I'm the face of the company to the customers, but also the voice of the customers, developers to like the internal product teams, tickets, Two Way street, you know, I mean evangelizing both ways.</p>

<p>00:26:12:</p>

<p>I think that's an important distinction from A I just I know I want to see you in, like this giant like Southern Baptist Church.</p>

<p>00:26:20:</p>

<p>Get the white robe on back from pop icon and I've come down from the mountain tops of of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>00:26:31:</p>

<p>It seemed like a conference talks.</p>

<p>00:26:32:</p>

<p>I'm just like if I can't get any feedback from the the group on talking, it's like such an uncomfortable experience to me.</p>

<p>00:26:39:</p>

<p>I feel just and so we're just talking at people.</p>

<p>00:26:42:</p>

<p>I mean, there's a lot of these podcasts like it's like talk with someone.</p>

<p>00:26:45:</p>

<p>It's, I don't know.</p>

<p>00:26:48:</p>

<p>It's I feel like you don't feel like I'm just like, yeah, bring on a stage or something.</p>

<p>00:26:51:</p>

<p>I just feel like I don't know I don't know Any time I'm bored of someone, I think I'm just talking at a wall like this.</p>

<p>00:26:56:</p>

<p>Working that's actually the hard part about Like doing these online conferences is like usually like me on a Web cam, talking like 1000 people and maybe a couple people are chatting just like Is this landing?</p>

<p>00:27:11:</p>

<p>Is this work?</p>

<p>00:27:12:</p>

<p>It's hard, It's It's hard to tell.</p>

<p>00:27:14:</p>

<p>Have you been doing it for the talks where they have like okay, you have to record your talk first?</p>

<p>00:27:20:</p>

<p>Yes, and then sit there as your talk is being played in the chat so that you can jump back live and answer questions.</p>

<p>00:27:28:</p>

<p>Jay, it's the worst.</p>

<p>00:27:30:</p>

<p>I you see what I do, and you're like they want you to be in the chat like talking live with the group, which is awesome.</p>

<p>00:27:36:</p>

<p>I love that, but like hearing yourself talk while doing it.</p>

<p>00:27:38:</p>

<p>It's like the worst experience.</p>

<p>00:27:41:</p>

<p>I have been just muting myself because I can't I can't listen to myself at all.</p>

<p>00:27:44:</p>

<p>I can't I can't do it.</p>

<p>00:27:46:</p>

<p>It's so hard.</p>

<p>00:27:48:</p>

<p>Okay, cool.</p>

<p>00:27:50:</p>

<p>No one's thrown me out of the bus in the chat.</p>

<p>00:27:53:</p>

<p>That's good.</p>

<p>00:27:54:</p>

<p>And J I hit more nervous for a prerecorded talk than I do for just a lifetime.</p>

<p>00:27:59:</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't even know if I can explain why it's so hard for me.</p>

<p>00:28:02:</p>

<p>I mean, having having tried to do, like, some course type stuff, I can understand it because when you're giving a talk and this is coming from someone who's, ah, license but non practicing minister like, Oh, I have actually had to go in like preach.</p>

<p>00:28:19:</p>

<p>And I tend tohave this thing where I like black out for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>00:28:24:</p>

<p>Yeah, And then I think at one point there was there was literally a sermon that I gave once where I told people like they didn't chill out.</p>

<p>00:28:31:</p>

<p>I was gonna just come out there and kick their ass.</p>

<p>00:28:33:</p>

<p>And it was like, This is not for me to aggressive.</p>

<p>00:28:39:</p>

<p>Yeah, that is like, I don't remember saying it, but it was just like it tonight.</p>

<p>00:28:43:</p>

<p>Traveling just takes over right?</p>

<p>00:28:46:</p>

<p>When I give a developer talk, it's like it's the same thing.</p>

<p>00:28:49:</p>

<p>It's like I can literally get up there.</p>

<p>00:28:52:</p>

<p>I've practiced.</p>

<p>00:28:53:</p>

<p>I've researched.</p>

<p>00:28:54:</p>

<p>I'm gonna black out spew whatever I have to say.</p>

<p>00:28:56:</p>

<p>Probably say something wrong.</p>

<p>00:28:58:</p>

<p>Try not to offend anyone and then jump down and be like, OK, cool.</p>

<p>00:29:03:</p>

<p>Now let me sit and talk with the people that just heard whatever it is, I said.</p>

<p>00:29:07:</p>

<p>And then when they tell me what they heard me say, I go, Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p>00:29:12:</p>

<p>That's exactly that's exactly what I was trying to get across.</p>

<p>00:29:17:</p>

<p>I love that.</p>

<p>00:29:18:</p>

<p>If you're recording a video, you're like it's just you and your thoughts and usually have your notes and you have it scripted.</p>

<p>00:29:23:</p>

<p>It's like right like I have Ah, no book here and I'm like, Well, yeah, that is instituted.</p>

<p>00:29:29:</p>

<p>It's like you can't It's so hard toe have that same type of I'm going to get up and do the thing that I get paid to do that.</p>

<p>00:29:38:</p>

<p>I'm confident about doing the energy that I know Aiken Dio when you shift it and put it all behind.</p>

<p>00:29:45:</p>

<p>Like, OK, we're gonna take this in 32 takes stitch together the best possible talk and then give you something to look at the end.</p>

<p>00:29:54:</p>

<p>I totally agree.</p>

<p>00:29:55:</p>

<p>It's it's hard like I am so mongo db We usually do like in person conference, and we have a lot of internal people who don't usually do talks they present.</p>

<p>00:30:04:</p>

<p>But we did it all online this year, obviously, because of cope it, Um, yeah, but it's hard.</p>

<p>00:30:09:</p>

<p>It was like it's a different feeling doing it unlined Teoh.</p>

<p>00:30:13:</p>

<p>I think the hardest part I've seen, too, is like you kind of don't you don't have that adrenaline.</p>

<p>00:30:18:</p>

<p>And I think if you're not ready for it, you kind of lose the energy.</p>

<p>00:30:21:</p>

<p>And I feel like, yeah, you know, it's like you're like right now.</p>

<p>00:30:25:</p>

<p>I'm just in my living room just talking at a wall with a webcam on it and like it could be easy go.</p>

<p>00:30:31:</p>

<p>It's like I don't have a crowd of people like hyping me up and cheering and clapping.</p>

<p>00:30:35:</p>

<p>It's like hard to keep the energy up.</p>

<p>00:30:37:</p>

<p>Uh, it's I don't be really intentional about it, Jay.</p>

<p>00:30:41:</p>

<p>I want to mention to in your talk with, like fighting someone during when you're talks.</p>

<p>00:30:44:</p>

<p>Like for me, what happens when I'm presenting?</p>

<p>00:30:47:</p>

<p>I lose all awareness of my body.</p>

<p>00:30:50:</p>

<p>It's, uh, it's just so weird.</p>

<p>00:30:54:</p>

<p>I don't It's like I'm focusing too much on like what I'm saying and how to say it.</p>

<p>00:30:58:</p>

<p>Then, like my body's like flailing around, waving the hands around, knocking things over and like hitting the microphone, its eyes were like a speech coach That's been like helping, like, retuned my my presence up and like, they're like, You gotta work on you gotta work on your body.</p>

<p>00:31:16:</p>

<p>It's like Is you looking like you look like a crazy person up there?</p>

<p>00:31:20:</p>

<p>Can't I'm so bad at it.</p>

<p>00:31:23:</p>

<p>The adrenal and I can't help.</p>

<p>00:31:24:</p>

<p>But I don't know, one of the talks I gave in Ah, North Bay, and this is probably the last thing before we jump into the after show one of the talks about North Bay.</p>

<p>00:31:33:</p>

<p>We, um it was the first talk I'd ever give, like first developer talk I had given.</p>

<p>00:31:38:</p>

<p>So and it was about podcasting.</p>

<p>00:31:41:</p>

<p>Yeah, developer conference.</p>

<p>00:31:43:</p>

<p>We're gonna talk about podcasts, and the interesting thing was I was so nervous and there was like, Oh, you'll do finally feel like you can do this.</p>

<p>00:31:53:</p>

<p>You got it.</p>

<p>00:31:53:</p>

<p>You get on podcast every week and talking stuff.</p>

<p>00:31:56:</p>

<p>It's just like a podcast.</p>

<p>00:31:57:</p>

<p>So I literally treated it like a podcast, like, you remember the whole, like, run through that I ran like that.</p>

<p>00:32:03:</p>

<p>I we did before we started is a What's your name to pronounce that enough.</p>

<p>00:32:06:</p>

<p>I literally went through that script, like, for myself.</p>

<p>00:32:12:</p>

<p>So I have My name is J.</p>

<p>00:32:13:</p>

<p>Miller.</p>

<p>00:32:13:</p>

<p>My pronouns air, he and him.</p>

<p>00:32:14:</p>

<p>I'm, uh we're gonna talk about this and then just jump into it, like, all right, I'm gonna get myself some time, drink some water, don't at the end.</p>

<p>00:32:23:</p>

<p>Like I was actually using the podium that they had out there to make sure that I wasn't like bouncing all over the place.</p>

<p>00:32:30:</p>

<p>It was just like I had her had a remote control.</p>

<p>00:32:33:</p>

<p>I was like, Hey, if a part of my body can't touch the podium, I've gone too far.</p>

<p>00:32:37:</p>

<p>I needed exactly baguette.</p>

<p>00:32:40:</p>

<p>You like tethers that podia I need, like, chain myself to it.</p>

<p>00:32:43:</p>

<p>Otherwise I am just Yeah, that's smart.</p>

<p>00:32:46:</p>

<p>That's more.</p>

<p>00:32:46:</p>

<p>You gotta like that.</p>

<p>00:32:47:</p>

<p>But some people like that, though, because I mean even afterwards, like I talked, Teoh, a developer advocate for Microsoft, was talking right after me, and he was like, Great job.</p>

<p>00:32:57:</p>

<p>You should have given that talk from the middle of the stage and not from the podium like that.</p>

<p>00:33:02:</p>

<p>He's like, That's the Onley.</p>

<p>00:33:04:</p>

<p>Like a point that I had is that you felt like you were tethered to that podium like I was.</p>

<p>00:33:08:</p>

<p>He was like, But no, you weren't.</p>

<p>00:33:09:</p>

<p>You had a lapel mic on you had a remote control like you literally caught your from anywhere.</p>

<p>00:33:14:</p>

<p>Why did you just keep yourself isolated?</p>

<p>00:33:16:</p>

<p>That one And I was like, Well, doing it.</p>

<p>00:33:18:</p>

<p>I guess it's not like Twitter.</p>

<p>00:33:19:</p>

<p>Like a podcast.</p>

<p>00:33:20:</p>

<p>I can totally the ability to move around.</p>

<p>00:33:23:</p>

<p>Yeah, I totally get that, too.</p>

<p>00:33:25:</p>

<p>Then that been smart.</p>

<p>00:33:26:</p>

<p>I know you think about like what you want to focus on or like trying hides its.</p>

<p>00:33:30:</p>

<p>I totally get that.</p>

<p>00:33:32:</p>

<p>I'm so bad that it's and I totally brew that my perception advocate a body body presence and like where you are so important, it's hard.</p>

<p>00:33:41:</p>

<p>It's hard to deal and like like twitching like podcasting.</p>

<p>00:33:44:</p>

<p>You're trying, like, manage a key point in time.</p>

<p>00:33:46:</p>

<p>I twitch trying like you track the track moderate that I'm trying like live code and salt record faltering problems live like deep like it.</p>

<p>00:33:54:</p>

<p>It's just like a lot.</p>

<p>00:33:56:</p>

<p>The things to balance mentally and our puny human brains can like.</p>

<p>00:34:00:</p>

<p>Our is terrible at multitasking.</p>

<p>00:34:02:</p>

<p>That's why you play video games on switch.</p>

<p>00:34:05:</p>

<p>Better.</p>

<p>00:34:06:</p>

<p>Better Doing actual work is hard, like it's all hard.</p>

<p>00:34:11:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:34:12:</p>

<p>It's so hard to do real work on their, uh, I've been doing life.</p>

<p>00:34:15:</p>

<p>Couldn't probably get your Now on there.</p>

<p>00:34:16:</p>

<p>It's It's it can hurt.</p>

<p>00:34:18:</p>

<p>It is nice.</p>

<p>00:34:19:</p>

<p>So if I get like a bug and some of the chat like notes of a software bug, which is nice, but that is it's pretty rare sleeping like, Wow, this guy doesn't just staring at me exactly.</p>

<p>00:34:32:</p>

<p>I'm sweating and floundering, trying to solve these problems live but to that point to idle like that's what like what's which, though it's like for me, I think it's important for me to be like exposed my anxiety and vulnerabilities for everyone's like, normalized that experience e think intact and especially developer Matt Evangelist.</p>

<p>00:34:50:</p>

<p>See you like we're delivering this fully formed perfect product for like, look at this cool prototype that shows this thing and like, you don't see the blood, sweat and tears that went into making that.</p>

<p>00:35:00:</p>

<p>I want you to see me crying while I'm making the thing.</p>

<p>00:35:05:</p>

<title>How I AutoUpdate My Github README using GitHub Actions in 5 Easy Steps</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>A new phenominon in the developer space is now the 🌟<em>secret</em>🌟 README.md
trick. If you have a repository with the EXACT (case-sensitive) name as your username, it will display the contents of that readme onto your GitHub profile.</p>

<p>Some folks have done really cool things with it, including setting up your own
Myspace-esque top8 (including Tom!).</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check it out. I made MySpace but on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>.<a href="https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR">https://t.co/p4DWP4DxRR</a> - My list is power by a GitHub Action workflow 😏 <a href="https://t.co/PN80mFCqOE">pic.twitter.com/PN80mFCqOE</a></p>&mdash; Brian Douglas (@bdougieYO) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieYO/status/1281699715466199040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">Simon Willison's</a> amazing self-updating profile, I wanted to do something similar.</p>

<p>Armed with the power of python (<em>and anime on my side</em>), I setout to do something similar. This is a look at the first steps of me automating my Github Profile.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Rename the repo my website to a repo named after my GitHub username</h3>

<p>This is easy enough. Just rename the repo (in Github) to your username.
Remember this has to be exact and it is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>You can do this in the settings menu of your repo. You don't have to change the
directory names or anything like that on a local machine. (I'm not sure if you
are using a Git Client other than the cli).</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a copy of your existing readme as a template</h3>

<p>My goal was to create my README using a Jinja2 and Github Actions. For that I
would need a template to render. So since most of the data was the same I just
copied my existing README.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Dynamic Content using Jinja2 Variables</h3>

<p>Starting out I wanted to show my latest blog post and my latest podcast episode
from <a href="https://podcast.productivityiintech.com">Productivity in Tech Podcast</a>. We will create a python script that does
this, but we needed to add the variables that Jinja2 would use for the dynamic
data.</p>

<p>You could do something like a search and replace, but I feel like just
rendering a template is much easier to edit and understand. Also, the compute
time for Github Actions is free and this doesn't need to be the most
performance conscious program. Also I like Jinja2, so there is also that 🙃.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gh"># From README_template.md</span>

You can see what he&#39;s posting about at &lt;https://kjaymiller.com&gt;.

<span class="gs">**Latest Post - [{{latest_post.title}}]({{latest_post.link}})**</span>

<span class="gs">**Latest Productivity in Tech Podcast Episode - [{{latest_podcast_post.title}}]({{latest_podcast_post.link}})**</span>

<span class="gu">## Active Projects</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Step 4: Build your script to get the data and write the up to date README.md</h3>

<p>This script is pretty simple once you know what you're looking for. I'm using
the feedparser plugin to parse the rss feeds and then returning the title and
link for the latest episode.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_latest_post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rss_feed</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h2>Step 5: Setup your Github Actions File</h2>

<p>I'm not the best at Github Actions. Luckily for me, this action was super
simple to setup. </p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/kjaymiller/blob/master/.github/workflows/latest_post_readme.yml">.yml file</a> I'm not going to talk about the setup of this
because most of it is prep stuff. Here's the important bit.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># in steps:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Install Feedparser &amp; Jinja2</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pip install feedparser jinja2</span>

<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Update Readme</span>
  <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">python ./.github/actions/update_readme.py</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Basically it's installing the things I need and then running the script (I
saved the script in that folder, but you don't really have to as long as its in
your repo).</p>

<p>After that, you add some commands to update your repo and you're off to the
races.</p>

<p>I have mine setup to update on a github push in that repo, but in the future I
will probably setup the file on a schedule to also update when I push something
new (Future Post...Probably).</p>

<title>Wayne Jones - Let&#39;s Learn Together - The PIT Show Preseason</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the PIT Show, a new format combining reflections and interviews with people working in technology. We're in the preseason so expect some changes, but we kick this off with an explainer, an interview with Wayne Jones and a tribute to Chadwick Boseman.</p>

<h2>Transcription</h2>

<p>Jay 00:00:00:</p>

<p>everybody, it's J real quick.</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:03:</p>

<p>There's gonna be a music change. Just so you know, we've been publishing these videos to YouTube. You can find more about that on productivity and tech dot com,</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:13:</p>

<p>but because we're gonna be pushing more and more on YouTube, I'm not able to use the existing Intron Outro music due to licensing reasons. Even though I've been given permission, I'm still going to get copyright strikes. So we've changed up the music. It's gonna be the music for the</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:34:</p>

<p>future until something changes it. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:38:</p>

<p>that's it. I'm also going to be doing a little bit with the rebranding, getting things done early. So there may be a little disconnect in the recorded audio in the interview and the intro. That's it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:56:</p>

<p>Under the show.</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:59:</p>

<p>It's too stays.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:20:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody? I'm J. Miller. This is the pit show. Now, you might be wondering. Wait a minute. I thought this was productivity and yeah, I know. We're gonna We're gonna talk about that in just a second. But I'm so glad that you are able to join me today. I've got a great interview coming up, but first, let's dive into this.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:42:</p>

<p>So what is this? Whatever you're looking at now,</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:45:</p>

<p>basically, the show has taken on this format. That was kind of by accident, where I started doing</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:56:</p>

<p>a reflection in an interview and a reflection and an interview and inter flexion and a review and all of these other things. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:07:</p>

<p>I kind of got tired of that. Honestly, I felt like what was really happening was that you were getting to shows and I thought to myself, If you're going to get two shows, why don't I just give you two shows, but not in the way that you think</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:22:</p>

<p>I didn't want to give you</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:25:</p>

<p>another feed? In fact, once upon a time, there used to be a show called The Pit Reflections, where literally, it was just me thinking and doing and talking and doing all that stuff. So if I wasn't going to give you two podcasts, but I was going to give you</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:42:</p>

<p>basically two different parts to one show, how could I do it better?</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:48:</p>

<p>And the solution that I came to was one that I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:53:</p>

<p>So here it is. Basically, you're going to get me talking just like I am now for a few minutes on every show.</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:01:</p>

<p>I'm gonna be talking a little bit about the subject that my guests will be talking about. I'll be talking a little bit about what's going on in my week. I'll be talking about a little bit. What's going on in, ah, current events? And then we'll jump into my interview</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:16:</p>

<p>now. In that interview,</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:18:</p>

<p>it will be the same interview that you're used to just a little bit shorter.</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:22:</p>

<p>Probably about 15 to 20 minutes sometimes maybe even 10 minutes. But here's the thing. I'm still going to give you the whole interview and I do that a couple of ways. One, I'm gonna stretch the interviews out a little bit. I'm going to cover a couple of different topics so that you can see</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:42:</p>

<p>that different parts of my guests as we're talking about things, and we often do this anyway. We often talk about</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:51:</p>

<p>a couple of different areas in their life, so it makes sense to do that anyway.</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:59:</p>

<p>Now, if you want to listen to the entire interview, you can still do that. I'm gonna be making the full interview available when the first episode drops on the bonus feed now for those that are listening to this for the first time, and you're just like this whole thing is just blowing my mind right now. The bonus feed is simply a free podcast that is available via the RSS feed only now there's a reason I do that one. I want to make sure that I'm able to put all of my focus and energy in the main show, but I also want to make sure that people are still getting the content that they want and deserve.</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:37:</p>

<p>So in order to get this bonus feed, all you have to do is sign up for</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:44:</p>

<p>the pit newsletter, go over to productivity in tech dot com, click the newsletter Link. Put your email address in. It's going to give you the RSS feed as your confirmation.</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:55:</p>

<p>If you unsubscribe after that, sure, whatever, that's fine. As long as you follow those steps, you'll get access to the bonus feet.</p>

<p>Jay 00:05:05:</p>

<p>Now</p>

<p>Jay 00:05:06:</p>

<p>you might be wondering, Is this gonna be a lot more work? You're right. It ISS.</p>

<p>Jay 00:05:12:</p>

<p>Every once in a while, I'm going to talk about a product or a thing that I'm doing or trying or looking at and those will probably have affiliate codes. Now, I try to think what would be the best way for me to</p>

<p>Jay 00:05:29:</p>

<p>make a little bit of money off of this show toe make up for the effort and the work that I'm putting in without selling your data without giving your information to third parties and the affiliate market is still probably the best way. In fact, it's kind of bad for me because I don't make that much off of affiliate revenue. I mean, I think last month on Amazon I made a whole $1.5. So there is that. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:05:55:</p>

<p>at the end of the day, the pit show is just one piece of an overall business that is productivity in tech. So I'm not too worried about making money on this side of it, because I'm gonna be making money from my clients that I work with. And also, you know, I've got a day job, so ah, lot of this is from the heart. A lot of this is just me wanting to show my passion and show my love for the things that I talk about. The guests that I bring on and The only way that I can continue to do that is that I make sure that there are no strings attached on the monetary side.</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:38:</p>

<p>So the last thing you might be thinking is what about the after show? The after show is still gonna be there. Still gonna be on the bonus feed. If you want it, you get it. It will be on a separate track from the</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:50:</p>

<p>full conversation. I'm still going to do that for you because I know some people prefer the after shows over the main shows. Some people don't want to listen to the after shows.</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:00:</p>

<p>I'm okay with all of that.</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:03:</p>

<p>So that's it. This is the pit show. This is the new thing. We got the new music at the interview. Still got the reflections. Still, I'm gonna skip the early reflection on this one and dive right into the interview.</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:15:</p>

<p>So this first interview waas with someone that I had just met online. I had listened to them give a talk about one of the projects that they had, and we'll get more to detail about that project on the second part of this conversation. But here it is, my conversation with Wayne Jones</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:40:</p>

<p>on the line with me. I have</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:43:</p>

<p>N Y u Grad, currently a full stack software engineer, and you can often catch him learning and hacking away on twitch the one the only Wayne Jones coming away from New York City. Weighing How are you doing this evening?</p>

<p>Wayne 00:08:00:</p>

<p>Doing are a just chillin weather's nice, So enjoying it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:05:</p>

<p>So this is this is one of the cool conversations that I've had just recently of, like, this idea of connecting with more and more developers online that are</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:17:</p>

<p>like, not giving keynote speeches. And then you gotta, like, try to send the email out and be like, Hey, sir, my you know, for you to be on my podcast, like being able to catch people on switch, doing cool stuff and ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:30:</p>

<p>man is interesting because I've been watching a lot of the coding stuff that you've been doing lately, and I'm</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:37:</p>

<p>I feel like I'm annoying you at times because it's just like, Hey, man, I know, I know you're just trying to show that you can do this, but shouldn't that be like</p>

<p>Wayne 00:08:47:</p>

<p>now, like I love the, um, the coding community on twitch and It's very fun, like, very helpful as well. Especially if I</p>

<p>Wayne 00:08:57:</p>

<p>going to a roadblock when it comes to coding and not necessarily knowing how to solve a solution.</p>

<p>Wayne 00:09:04:</p>

<p>Community is definitely there to help. Um, yeah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:08:</p>

<p>how How has that been? Because I just got into, like, doing a lot more like coding live streams. And I've noticed more and more like you have a couple of types of folks that come into the stream. You have the people that, like know what they're doing and are just there to tell you that you're doing it wrong. And then you also have, like, the people that have, like, no idea what's going on. So they're just asking 1000 questions. And you're like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:35:</p>

<p>as much as I want to help you right now,</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:38:</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure this out like I can't answer this question because I don't know the answer.</p>

<p>Wayne 00:09:44:</p>

<p>Yeah, and like it,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:09:47:</p>

<p>it's like for some of my streams, like I do algorithm type questions. So this is like the typical questions you'll see in a technical interview and then some streams. I'm doing like, uh,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:00:</p>

<p>doing like, my own assignment. A coding assignments, um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:05:</p>

<p>or maybe a personal project that, like it seems like</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:09:</p>

<p>depending on what type of content that I'm doing, you would have different types of people that are, um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:16:</p>

<p>watching your stream. So, like, for algorithm questions, those are typically the people that are trying to learn a little bit more about, um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:24:</p>

<p>coding in general,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:26:</p>

<p>building out your algorithms had optimized solution. Um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:31:</p>

<p>And for me, um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:34:</p>

<p>in terms of like doing these streams,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:36:</p>

<p>I am not only the person that, like</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:40:</p>

<p>I guess can give the answers when it comes to like, these algorithm type questions. But also, I'm learning as well as I'm coding eso. It's just like I'm learning from the community. Um, pretty much coding as I go that I call it where it's like</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:56:</p>

<p>it puts it more into perspective.</p>

<p>Wayne 00:10:59:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:00:</p>

<p>when you're watching a stream like minds because</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:03:</p>

<p>me personally, I'm a developer for six years as a full stack Web developer, but</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:09:</p>

<p>even myself, with all these years of experience, I don't have all the answers and you'll see me make stupid mistakes. You'll see me have, like, syntax, errors of missing semi colon, and it will take me like 30 minutes, debug and I'm like,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:26:</p>

<p>uh, face palming the entire time once I figure out the answer to my problems, but</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:32:</p>

<p>yeah, it's</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:33:</p>

<p>it puts, I guess, my shame in general. Just put ST Moritz respect. Perspective. Um,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:39:</p>

<p>when it comes suggests learning with me, learning the fundamentals of coding. Andi,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:11:47:</p>

<p>just like program, lingers in general.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:50:</p>

<p>No, I love that. And I love that. Like one of the things that you were talking about there is like</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:55:</p>

<p>being being able to</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:58:</p>

<p>stream, even though you don't have all the answers. Like, I think that that's</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:03:</p>

<p>that's such a</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:06:</p>

<p>strange thing because, you know, one of the things that I've always I've always tried to like, tell people like you don't have to always put</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:13:</p>

<p>your best foot forward, but like at least show that you're trying to put your best before like</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:22:</p>

<p>no one expects everyone to have, like all the answers 100% of time. Well, I'm wrong. The Internet expects you to have all the answers are present at the time, But people in reality,</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:35:</p>

<p>I feel like it's easier to relate to someone who is struggling, and in fact that's</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:40:</p>

<p>one of the things that we have in common is we both stream like late at night and I can only imagine, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:12:47:</p>

<p>for me when I'm streaming I've been working all day, I get double work and I'm like, All right now it's timeto start writing code for projects that I'm passionate about, and it's like I'm so tired like I can't think about this. And so many times I've just been like, all right, where stream is over. Like, Let's we're calling it here because I can't figure this out. And then the very next morning, like, I come up with solution in like, 20 minutes and I'm like saying I should have just went to sleep earlier and then I would have had</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:16:</p>

<p>the problem.</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:16:</p>

<p>That the answer. Do you have the same problem? Like I know you stream late at night to write?</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:21:</p>

<p>Yeah, I stood in late tonight here in New York. Um, so it goes to, like,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:26:</p>

<p>maybe I start machine maybe around 6 to 7 p.m. Even though I've been wanting to start a little bit earlier. But I usually end my streams around like midnight one AM and I'm like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:37:</p>

<p>i e I'm done. I</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:40:</p>

<p>need to stop here, so I'm not getting any sleep.</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:43:</p>

<p>Has screaming kind of been like the replacement for going to meet ups and local events?</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:49:</p>

<p>Yeah, well, streaming in general like</p>

<p>Wayne 00:13:53:</p>

<p>like for me personally before pre cove it. I've never went to any developer conferences to learn about new technologies. And I guess this covert situation I guess the pros out of this, if you can call it that, is that most of these deaf conferences air now online. And now you can just, uh, sign up. Most of them were for free. You can go online and learn something new. Eso for me. Personally, I've been focused mainly on react, but I've been babbling into a little bit more about continue ization including docker kubernetes um, learning a little bit more about no Js on the back end on. And, of course, just doing things that manipulating things to react</p>

<p>Wayne 00:14:42:</p>

<p>dollars to, like fast since the colors and then, um, paying for travel and lodging,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:14:50:</p>

<p>it's just the costs adds up on. And of course, I didn't have a didn't have a company that would pay for, uh, me to travel to these conferences, although that would be ideal. But I didn't have that opportunity.</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:04:</p>

<p>I definitely get that. I mean, currently, I'm working as a marketer. So what? I tell them like, Hey, I want to go to this event. They're like, Oh, is it like Adobe Maximum like, No, it's pie Khan and it's in Pittsburgh and it's for a week and they're like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:21:</p>

<p>Yeah, I know you can. You can take vacation and and do that but I think some time off exactly. And I think that that's the being that</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:32:</p>

<p>I hope.</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:33:</p>

<p>I hope we learned from this this time of not being able t gather in place. I mean, we watched</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:41:</p>

<p>some of the largest conferences in the world. Some of the largest tech conferences in the world moved an online platform and become available for the first time for so many people that whether you can afford a ticket or you can't afford travel and things like that one of like, I think the second conference I ever went to, the only reason I went was because</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:04:</p>

<p>I split my hotel fair with a friend of mine.</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:07:</p>

<p>I got my flight covered by the conference organizers, so the only thing I had to pay for like in full was my ticket to the conference, and the tickets were like 25 bucks. And it was like, So for like that, it was like, Yes, this is This is exactly how I go to this conference. But every other conference, like, I like local conferences. I like the small, like, two day conferences that air like $50 for a ticket, and you only got to get a hotel room for like, a single night because a nobody trying to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pocket to go to an event and</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:45:</p>

<p>and you could just present it online like I love how pie cascades like they live stream their conference like the entire like If you don't have a ticket, that's fine. Just log onto YouTube and it's there. It's being presented live. And then, like North Bay Python, they do. They work with, uh,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:02:</p>

<p>a company called Next Day Video, and</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:06:</p>

<p>we're literally giving the conference talk and then getting an email like an hour and a half later, like Hey, do your do you consent to release this video on the YouTube and it's like all day and I was quick and like, literally, you got conference videos up the next day and you're like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:20:</p>

<p>This is what? This is how it should be. Like, I'm glad that a lot of these places put their videos and stuff up, but</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:26:</p>

<p>I love that they're smaller conferences that are able to be like, as soon as the talk is given, It's like we're already getting it ready for the rest of the world to consume.</p>

<p>Wayne 00:17:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, with this, I guess, with this whole Kobe environment.</p>

<p>Wayne 00:17:40:</p>

<p>And once you go back to, like, quote unquote normal. Ah,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:17:45:</p>

<p>I guess environment or situation, um, I'm hoping, and I tweeted this out that I'm hoping all these, like developer conferences have more, um, accessible type of means of,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:17:59:</p>

<p>I guess,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:18:00:</p>

<p>showing off the different keynotes and different workshops via, like, streaming tools like YouTube or twitch,</p>

<p>Wayne 00:18:09:</p>

<p>and hopefully be a little bit more accessible to develop those who can't afford to go out to these</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:14:</p>

<p>conferences.</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:28:</p>

<p>All right, let me tell you all story</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:31:</p>

<p>in 2018 to amazing movies came out that absolutely changed</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:38:</p>

<p>my mind, set on</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:42:</p>

<p>what was important in black cinema,</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:45:</p>

<p>and that was</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:47:</p>

<p>Black Panther</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:48:</p>

<p>and Spider Man into the spider verse. I think you know where I'm going here. If you don't well, listen anyway,</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:56:</p>

<p>2018 was also the same year that my daughter was born,</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:00:</p>

<p>so I spent most of 2018 either</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:04:</p>

<p>anticipating my first child or not sleeping because of my first child.</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:12:</p>

<p>One of the things that stressed me out more than anything was the lack of representation</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:18:</p>

<p>for people of color</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:20:</p>

<p>in the space</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:22:</p>

<p>in any space. I mean the fact that we have an entire month where we can talk about all the great African Americans and black, um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:34:</p>

<p>ethnic groups and individuals that did amazing things. The fact that we cover all of that in one month kind of tells you that there's a lack of information and knowledge and observance</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:49:</p>

<p>of people of color doing amazing things.</p>

<p>Jay 00:19:53:</p>

<p>I've said it before, and plenty of the interviews that I've had and that I've given with people that I think that the biggest thing that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:05:</p>

<p>the biggest thing that impacted me</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:09:</p>

<p>in my career path</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:11:</p>

<p>was finally seeing people that looked like me</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:16:</p>

<p>being successful, seeing people in the position that I'm in now making it. In fact, that's What my life goal is is to find people of all races, all ethnicities, all sexual orientations that are like me in some way, shape or form, and to show them</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:38:</p>

<p>that just because they're weird just because they're into rock and, like all other black friends aren't just because they like computers or whatever, that makes you normal.</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:49:</p>

<p>And you have a pathway to success</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:52:</p>

<p>you're talking to, Ah, college dropout that is doing amazing for himself in his family.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:00:</p>

<p>But I didn't see that growing up. I saw drug dealers. I saw crackheads.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:06:</p>

<p>I saw dropouts, rejects.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:09:</p>

<p>I saw all of these things, but I saw a lack of success.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:15:</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2018.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:17:</p>

<p>I am for the first time seeing superheroes being portrayed as people of color.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:23:</p>

<p>I knew the story of Black Panther following in the comics, but it wasn't one that was told. It was one that was kind of behind the scenes a little bit. So it was great to see these stories being put on screen, not stories about civil rights.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:41:</p>

<p>It's so important that we have those conversations,</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:44:</p>

<p>but I'm tired of people of color only being asked to sit at the table to talk about their troubles.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:50:</p>

<p>So to actually have someone come in and be a superhero meant the world to me.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:55:</p>

<p>Then I saw Spiderman into the spider verse.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:59:</p>

<p>I knew of Miles Morales,</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:02:</p>

<p>but that was just another example of breaking into a space that was primarily not reserved</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:11:</p>

<p>for black people. For people of color, people of color didn't have a spot in</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:17:</p>

<p>animated cartoons.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:20:</p>

<p>And if they did, it was always the gangbangers and the Gangsters or the B rated superheroes like Static Shock.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:32:</p>

<p>One of the people that helped</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:34:</p>

<p>make that a reality</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:38:</p>

<p>passed away.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:40:</p>

<p>Chadwick Boseman,</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:42:</p>

<p>someone who had</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:45:</p>

<p>the suave and swagger of</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:50:</p>

<p>an address, Elba or a Denzel Washington,</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:53:</p>

<p>but was making stuff for my generation and for the generation that would come behind me,</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:00:</p>

<p>someone that spent</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:03:</p>

<p>the primary portion of his most successful moments</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:08:</p>

<p>fighting</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:09:</p>

<p>disease and illness,</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:13:</p>

<p>someone that was taken away really early.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:17:</p>

<p>I had this whole thing planned out about how August was over and how it was starting September off of my Boo Joe and all that stuff. But then I realized it was so much more important</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:28:</p>

<p>to take a second</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:30:</p>

<p>in a world that's full of hatred in a world that's full of protest ing and riots in a world that's full of disease</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:38:</p>

<p>to just stop and bring a little clarity toe why</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:43:</p>

<p>people like Chadwick, Boseman or so</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:47:</p>

<p>important.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:50:</p>

<p>And he's not the last person.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:52:</p>

<p>I'm glad to see that we have new action stars. I'm glad to see people like Michael B. Jordan, who have been watching since he was a kid on hardball.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:02:</p>

<p>I'm glad that we can see</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:04:</p>

<p>black executives like Soma ST John.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:09:</p>

<p>I'm glad that we're starting to see these things,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:13:</p>

<p>but I have to stop and take a moment</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:16:</p>

<p>for a younger version of me</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:20:</p>

<p>that wish he would have been a kid when he first saw Black Panther</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:25:</p>

<p>that he would have been a kid when he first found out about Miles Morales.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:31:</p>

<p>I'm sad,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:33:</p>

<p>and I mourn the loss of Chadwick Boseman,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:37:</p>

<p>King T'challa.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:39:</p>

<p>But I'm encouraged</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:41:</p>

<p>because I know that he left a legacy</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:46:</p>

<p>that will hopefully inspire my little daughter</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:50:</p>

<p>and will inspire more people like me</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:54:</p>

<p>in the future.</p>

<title>The Cost of Running with Scratched Itches</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have friends that make things. They also inspire me to make things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me - OMG Massive product update! But for real, when you going to charge for this...?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Friend - Can you imagine the support time if it were a paid product?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think of myself as an <em>itch scratcher</em> or somoneone who does things because they want to do things. I blame my ADHD. Once the itch has been scratched I move on to the next itch. There's probably a metaphor about "leaving scars" there but I'll not belabor the point.</p>

<p>This is a little reminder that when you build a thing, there are little costs that come with doing it. Sometimes it's better to layout that your itch <strong>is just an itch</strong> and leave it at that.</p>

<title>Can we fix this?</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been mostly silent in this time, mostly as I needed time to think
about what I would like to see come out of all this.</p>

<h2>How to Fix Racism</h2>

<p>Racism is all over the world. Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.</p>

<p>I don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and
become equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.
Instead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust
punishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never
able to gain any amount of legitimate growth.</p>

<p>Force the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that
are disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest
person of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the
only one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.</p>

<p>If you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely
(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for
you.</p>

<h2>On Rioting</h2>

<p>In my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.
Furthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me
from my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked
to be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and
the fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint
and had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took
them from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the
age of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop
car over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,
uneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you
have pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local
communities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation
of Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict
government oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.</p>

<p>It took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is
founded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we
murdered until we got it.</p>

<p>We did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to
ourselves (see civil war).</p>

<p>Now when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our
nation call us Terrorists.</p>

<p>While I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and
maintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying
the example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those
that murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while
the rest of society looked away.</p>

<h2>On The Legal System</h2>

<p>In regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who
have the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout
my wishes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down</li>
<li>More racial and gender diversity in police forces</li>
<li>Mandatory implicit bias checks and training</li>
<li>Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making
an arrest.</li>
<li>The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws</li>
</ul>

<p>These ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how
they can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that
can't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up
for themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly. And be willing to listen when we do speak up.</p>

<title>In Defense of the Black Multi-Potentialite</title>  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p><em>Stay in Your Lane.</em> - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Shut up and Dribble.</em> - Laura Ingraham</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why does every black actor gotta rap some. I don't know. All I know is I'm the best one.</em> - Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.</p>

<p>For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.</p>

<p>For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. </p>

<p>I joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>But Why</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what is a man, what has he got?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not himself, then he has naught</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say the things he truly feels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And not the words of one who kneels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The record shows, I took the blows</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. </p>

<p>In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.</p>

<p>When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).</p>

<p>In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.</p>

<h3>I do a lot.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I work a Day job.</li>
<li>I manage a <a href="https://productivityintech.com">side business</a> helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller">write code</a>.</li>
<li>I host a range of <a href="/projects">podcasts</a> from tech to gaming.</li>
<li>I'm a member of an Esports organization and <a href="https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller">stream regularly</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My <em>coding</em> skills help me <strong>automate</strong> and <strong>optimize</strong> my day job.</p>

<p>My <em>day job</em> skills, challenge me to <strong>think differently</strong> and <strong>shake up stale thought</strong>.</p>

<p>My <em>podcasting</em> and <em>streaming</em> skills gave me the ability to identify ways that <strong>I could help my
side-business clients</strong> in <strong>their</strong> content-creating journey.</p>

<p>They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. </p>

<p>I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. </p>

<p>Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.</p>

<p>Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.</p>

<p>My child will grow up seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.</p>

<h2>Transcription</h2>

<p>00:00:18:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>Jay Miller here back with a solo PIT Reflection type thing for the first half of June 2020. this year has sucked royally.</p>

<p>00:00:32:</p>

<p>I don't even want to get into this. Um, all of the individual things that have happened in 2020 have just been nightmarish at best.</p>

<p>00:00:46:</p>

<p>So this is going to be more of a productivity's side thought exercise for me, and I hope that it will engage your mind a little bit as we sit down and talk.</p>

<p>That said, it is gonna be a little bit off the head. I have some notes and I'll use those notes. But ultimately, I'm just using them to riff off of.</p>

<p>00:01:13:</p>

<p>So let's start with a couple of things. First of all, productivity's in general. What am I doing, Productivity wise?</p>

<p>Um, if you would have asked me this question yesterday, I would have told you something different. I am jumping back to the notebook. I go to the notebook like probably once a year. I'm gonna try to do a full year.</p>

<p>00:01:38:</p>

<p>Don't at me. Don't challenge me. Don't do any of those things the way that I see it productivity tools, productivity, apps, productivity. All of those things should be used for you to do your best work. None of these tools should be considered a Bible or any type of gospel for you to breach or proselytize on others.</p>

<p>00:02:06:</p>

<p>In fact, I'm not using this podcast to preach or proselytize my own productivity method. I am merely telling people how I am doing a thing in hopes that if someone else that is doing something similar here, is it that I might be able to inspire them to try something that works for them or for them to reach out to me and let me know of something that did work for them without any obligation to join the Church of Notion or Rome research or obsidian or all these other apps that said, Let's jump into this.</p>

<p>00:02:51:</p>

<p>What absolute using. Like I said, up until today, when I said, You know what, we need to get back on our analog light, our BuJo-esque system.</p>

<p>00:03:03:</p>

<p>I would have said I was using OmniFocus. Um, I think for right now I I don't really have too much stuff in OmniFocus. That will make it hard to transition.</p>

<p>00:03:19:</p>

<p>I wasn't really using OmniFocus as the power tool that most people use it as, um, it was simply a way for me to differ things so that I didn't have to look at him.</p>

<p>Good thing is a notebook and a piece of paper kind of does the same thing. I just don't need to look at it now.</p>

<p>00:03:39:</p>

<p>One of the biggest apps that I have jumped on. Probably the biggest change in my workflow since leaving Evernote back in 2000 and what, 10? Yeah, I think 2010 was when I left Evernote or not.</p>

<p>00:03:57:</p>

<p>Didn't leave it like the company I stopped using.</p>

<p>00:03:59:</p>

<p>The application is the adoption of DEVONthink now, DEVONthink, is one of these tools that I think that a lot of people are intimidated by one.</p>

<p>00:04:13:</p>

<p>It's an expensive tool.</p>

<p>00:04:15:</p>

<p>I get that. Yeah, it's expensive.</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>Oh, boy, A suspensive.</p>

<p>It's like fountain pen money expensive.</p>

<p>00:04:23:</p>

<p>The thing I like about DEVONthink is I don't have to question where I put a thing.</p>

<p>00:04:31:</p>

<p>I deal with a lot of files between the day job, the side business and the other ambitions and inspirations that I have.</p>

<p>00:04:42:</p>

<p>So for me, it is important that when I'm looking for a thing, I can find it with relative ease.</p>

<p>00:04:51:</p>

<p>DEVONthink allows me to do that.</p>

<p>00:04:54:</p>

<p>It does its job really well.</p>

<p>00:04:58:</p>

<p>And the thing that makes it different from, you know, another power tool that I use Drafts or Evernote or again, like a Notion or Rome Research kind of tool is that one.</p>

<p>00:05:15:</p>

<p>It beats all the cloud tools because it's designed to work with my local machine.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>So adding some order to my chaotic system.</p>

<p>00:05:26:</p>

<p>The other thing that it does is it make some connections and allows me to easily connect things that should be connected.</p>

<p>00:05:39:</p>

<p>And it allows me to look at different things from many different schools of thought, which isn't always the best way to do things.</p>

<p>00:05:54:</p>

<p>But when you need to, it is amazing.</p>

<p>00:06:01:</p>

<p>So again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this.</p>

<p>00:06:03:</p>

<p>If you've been looking at DEVONthink you'd know all the stuff that I could talk about with it?</p>

<p>00:06:09:</p>

<p>Um, if you aren't looking into DEVONthink unless you just genuinely have a problem with maintaining lots and lots of files and documents and things like that over a long period of time.</p>

<p>00:06:22:</p>

<p>Or you're just fed up with Evernote as a whole and its inability to, um, not move like a giant green elephant in a china shop, you know, then I mean, give it a try.</p>

<p>00:06:37:</p>

<p>There's a free trial.</p>

<p>00:06:38:</p>

<p>Give it a shot.</p>

<p>00:06:39:</p>

<p>I mean, if you really want to talk about it, they have a forum.</p>

<p>00:06:42:</p>

<p>They have, um a lot of people that air again, much more avid users shout out to the Nested Folders podcast.</p>

<p>00:06:50:</p>

<p>They did a great to show seriess on how they both use. DEVONthink in their own systems.</p>

<p>00:06:59:</p>

<p>One, uh, uses it more of, ah, file cabinet, the other one more of ah ah, thought companion.</p>

<p>00:07:10:</p>

<p>But there's an app that I wanted to talk about a little bit from the business side, and this is after I haven't used a hun.</p>

<p>00:07:23:</p>

<p>But I've used it.</p>

<p>00:07:25:</p>

<p>And when I have used it, it has had a really good effect.</p>

<p>00:07:30:</p>

<p>Uh, I used to do business meetings any type of any time I was doing, like a client consultation.</p>

<p>00:07:36:</p>

<p>I would use something like notion.</p>

<p>00:07:39:</p>

<p>Um, I'm a firm believer in the idea of shared notes are better when you're able to collaborate on them.</p>

<p>00:07:50:</p>

<p>The one problem that I had with notion initially was that you know, you get us up in account, you got to give them access, they can watch, you do stuff, and that's cool.</p>

<p>00:07:59:</p>

<p>But ultimately, it doesn't feel as inviting for someone that's not a part of your team to come in and start working with you.</p>

<p>00:08:07:</p>

<p>And there was also, like the pricing question and things like that.</p>

<p>00:08:10:</p>

<p>But for the last couple of consultations that I've had, I have used a tool called Miro. MIRO is an interesting little tool.</p>

<p>00:08:22:</p>

<p>It is basically a collaborative white board, and it's designed to be a collaborative white board. One of the things I like about is that it also gives you a section for your notes. It allows you to attach things. It allows you to collect a bunch of stuff under one umbrella.</p>

<p>00:08:38:</p>

<p>I mean, imagine having a giant whiteboard and being able to just have everybody writing on it and asking questions and commenting and doing things like that.</p>

<p>00:08:49:</p>

<p>I really like it, Um, especially for like a consultation type thing.</p>

<p>00:08:57:</p>

<p>I haven't used it at the premium level where they have stuff like of voice and video chat and stuff like that.</p>

<p>00:09:06:</p>

<p>I mean, just you zoom.</p>

<p>00:09:08:</p>

<p>Or I think in my last consultation call, I like, I think we just use facetime and then, as we were talking, you know, we're both adding stuff into it so that's cool by itself.</p>

<p>00:09:21:</p>

<p>But yeah, I mean, again, just this isn't an attempt to get people to try stuff.</p>

<p>00:09:27:</p>

<p>It's more of Ah, hey, here's something that if you haven't heard about it and it's something that it suits you, then sure, why not take a crack at it?</p>

<p>00:09:34:</p>

<p>It's not gonna be life changing for someone unless it is the exact thing that they're looking for.</p>

<p>00:09:42:</p>

<p>So we've talked a little bit about the productivity side of things.</p>

<p>00:09:47:</p>

<p>Let's jump into the projects.</p>

<p>00:09:51:</p>

<p>Ah, but to do nothings really changed much on the project side of life.</p>

<p>00:09:55:</p>

<p>I mean, it is it's still basically render engine and transcript.</p>

<p>00:09:59:</p>

<p>Or for me, I do believe the last time we had a conversation like this transcriptor was still just a Django app now it is no longer Django app.</p>

<p>00:10:09:</p>

<p>It is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor/">python package</a>.</p>

<p>00:10:13:</p>

<p>Yes, but he s the best way to put it.</p>

<p>00:10:16:</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I realized that I don't want to build a SaaS app.</p>

<p>00:10:21:</p>

<p>I know that there are a bunch of people out there.</p>

<p>00:10:23:</p>

<p>They're like, "Oh, yeah, SaaS applications!"</p>

<p>00:10:25:</p>

<p>"That's passive income and smart revenue."</p>

<p>00:10:28:</p>

<p>And there's a whole conversation to have about that.</p>

<p>00:10:31:</p>

<p>But that is not me.</p>

<p>00:10:33:</p>

<p>What I enjoy doing more than anything is helping people directly by me providing a service to them.</p>

<p>00:10:41:</p>

<p>Now I know that's not scalable.</p>

<p>00:10:43:</p>

<p>I understand that.</p>

<p>00:10:45:</p>

<p>I don't care.</p>

<p>00:10:46:</p>

<p>Um, there's a excellent book that I've been reading on and off, you know, for the last who knows how long.</p>

<p>00:10:52:</p>

<p>Called <em>Company of One</em>_ by Paul Jarvis.</p>

<p>00:10:55:</p>

<p>I think that there is an amazing idea and an amazing benefit to imposing a limit of scalability on yourself and on your company.</p>

<p>00:11:09:</p>

<p>And here's Here's what I mean, if I use pit transcriptor, as you know, we'll pick transcript of the Django app.</p>

<p>00:11:17:</p>

<p>It's a great tool that allows anybody to sign up for an account and start doing transcriptions and Ultimately, I'm eating the cost, which means I'm having to charge people memberships, which means I am now in the business of customer service.</p>

<p>00:11:31:</p>

<p>I'm in the business of tech support, and I am in the business of having to explain to people why Amazon transcribe does some of the things that it does because of how it does it.</p>

<p>00:11:44:</p>

<p>And there are a lot of different things that Amazon transcribe Google Cloud Platform or Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>00:11:54:</p>

<p>All of these services do certain things because they have to in order to scale at the level that they want to scale.</p>

<p>00:12:03:</p>

<p>But what's the alternative here?</p>

<p>00:12:07:</p>

<p>I could build a system that allows me personally to do transcriptions at a rate that I can afford in that I could maintain and by providing it as a python package.</p>

<p>00:12:22:</p>

<p>There is a level of support that I'm willing to give, but a lot of that is I can now define the scope of the application of the package that I'm supporting.</p>

<p>00:12:37:</p>

<p>If I decide that the transcript or packages on Lee going to support AWS Transcribe, then okay, I have the ability to do that if I decide that transcriptor is not going to support custom vocabulary.</p>

<p>00:13:03:</p>

<p>I can do that if I and these are all things that I have chosen to do.</p>

<p>00:13:13:</p>

<p>If I decide that transcript is only going to focus on the resulted output of a transcription job and not the actual processing of the job itself, I conduce that.</p>

<p>00:13:29:</p>

<p>And by doing that, I narrow the scope that I am responsible for to my clients.</p>

<p>00:13:38:</p>

<p>I'm Onley responsible for the actual job that they're paying me to do.</p>

<p>00:13:47:</p>

<p>They're not paying me to maintain a python packages or maintaining Meteo or they're paying me too.</p>

<p>00:13:52:</p>

<p>Provide them with a transcription.</p>

<p>00:13:57:</p>

<p>And the developers that are using the tool that I have built are I mean, they're not paying me at all, but they're relying on me, too.</p>

<p>00:14:10:</p>

<p>Provide a level of knowledge and service about the platform, or about the system that I have created all while while having the ability to take it and make it their own because it is an open source.</p>

<p>00:14:25:</p>

<p>A pack same thing with render engine render engine by default as a static side generator is designed to be very flexible, but because I'm not selling static sites is a service.</p>

<p>00:14:45:</p>

<p>I'm only providing a system for generating sites.</p>

<p>00:14:52:</p>

<p>That is a level of insight that I don't have to provide.</p>

<p>00:14:56:</p>

<p>I don't have to teach people proper SEO.</p>

<p>00:14:59:</p>

<p>I don't have to teach people proper CDN usage and compression of images and things like that.</p>

<p>00:15:05:</p>

<p>My system does not care about these things.</p>

<p>00:15:09:</p>

<p>It does not benefit them anyway.</p>

<p>00:15:11:</p>

<p>The only way that we were able to integrate sire like a search capability, like for those who don't know, one of the big achievements of he had this year for render engine is the integration in with a fuse dot Js, which is a static site search.</p>

<p>00:15:30:</p>

<p>Um, that's all done on the client side.</p>

<p>00:15:34:</p>

<p>Basically, you supply a JavaScript package with a JSON Output and you can search that file poor content.</p>

<p>00:15:46:</p>

<p>Now they're probably better ways to do it.</p>

<p>00:15:50:</p>

<p>I'm sure you could offload that to another service, but my assumption is if you're building static sites, you have a certain thought about offloading stuff to third party service.</p>

<p>00:16:07:</p>

<p>Um, but, you know, part of my thought pattern was Do I want to support looter?</p>

<p>00:16:14:</p>

<p>Another static site search engine do I want to support, um, elastic search and do I want to support?</p>

<p>00:16:23:</p>

<p>You know, Al Gore, Uh, or out was What is it?</p>

<p>00:16:28:</p>

<p>Yeah, Al Gore as either Algora or Algoria.</p>

<p>00:16:31:</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>

<p>00:16:31:</p>

<p>I think it's Algora.</p>

<p>00:16:33:</p>

<p>And because I wasn't saying, "Hey, everybody, here's a platform that, you know, you give me $10 a month and I host your static site."</p>

<p>00:16:45:</p>

<p>And there's nothing wrong with people that are doing that.</p>

<p>00:16:47:</p>

<p>You know, shout out to the whole micro.blog service and Manton Reese and Jene McDonald and the other people that are a part of making that a reality.</p>

<p>00:16:56:</p>

<p>Um, that's just not me.</p>

<p>00:16:58:</p>

<p>That's just not what I'm aiming to do.</p>

<p>00:17:01:</p>

<p>I would much rather make sure stuff that I'm doing is compatible with what they're doing.</p>

<p>00:17:06:</p>

<p>And they have really made that easy.</p>

<p>00:17:07:</p>

<p>So again, big shout out to them.</p>

<p>00:17:12:</p>

<p>So I guess in this rambling that is kind of my big take away in this whole conversation is there's something to say about the idea of controlling the scope of your projects, and that is something that I am learning more and more of as I get older and as I want to do more things while having more responsibilities is, I have to be able to control the scope of what I'm doing.</p>

<p>00:17:50:</p>

<p>So the big pit question for you that I want to hear about, whether it's on Twitter or whether you want to email me at info it productivity in tech dot com is how are you controlling the scope of the things that you're doing?</p>

<p>00:18:13:</p>

<p>And furthermore, what can you do in order to begin controlling the scope of some things that might have gotten out of control?</p>

<p>00:18:30:</p>

<p>I'm gonna leave it there because the last, you know, five minutes or so of this little podcast thing, it's going to be devoted to a little bit of, ah administration work here.</p>

<p>00:18:45:</p>

<p>So I've been thinking more and more about Pitt as a community, as a group of people Maurin Mawr during this time with racial injustice and things like that happening.</p>

<p>00:19:04:</p>

<p>Have I not been more proud of the black community that I've been a part of, you know, obviously from birth, but also the vocal community and the amount of ally ship that I have around me and that has made me want to value the people within that community.</p>

<p>00:19:29:</p>

<p>More and more now, I'm still not sure how that involves pit, but what I have learned is that I want to be able to support of the things and the people that are doing amazing things more and more.</p>

<p>00:19:50:</p>

<p>And by doing that, I have to have the support of the community.</p>

<p>00:19:55:</p>

<p>So here is my I thought I would be willing toe have more conversations like this on a regular basis if there were some form of feedback one, there has to be feedback on it.</p>

<p>00:20:23:</p>

<p>I don't I don't mind shouting into the either, but the actual time it takes tow, edit and record this.</p>

<p>00:20:29:</p>

<p>And I mean, even the editing isn't much, but I cough a lot.</p>

<p>00:20:32:</p>

<p>I'm an asthmatic.</p>

<p>00:20:32:</p>

<p>I'm a chronic asthmatic.</p>

<p>00:20:34:</p>

<p>There's a lot of coughing that's involved in a lot of people.</p>

<p>00:20:36:</p>

<p>Sometimes here and then sometimes don't hear, depending on my mood.</p>

<p>00:20:43:</p>

<p>One.</p>

<p>00:20:44:</p>

<p>There's got to be feedback in the term and in actual like conversation.</p>

<p>00:20:51:</p>

<p>I'm only sharing this stuff with you because I want to start a conversation.</p>

<p>00:20:58:</p>

<p>If there's no desire for a conversation to be had then I have no reason to continues speaking about it.</p>

<p>00:21:10:</p>

<p>The other side is it has to make sense from a time value perspective.</p>

<p>00:21:18:</p>

<p>As some may noticed, I have upped the transparency of me searching for, um, I want to say a job, but searching for a way to provide for my family?</p>

<p>00:21:33:</p>

<p>No, I have a job.</p>

<p>00:21:36:</p>

<p>I'm not worried about getting fired today, at least, and pit is still growing.</p>

<p>00:21:43:</p>

<p>I mean, last year was the best year for pit, which I mean.</p>

<p>00:21:47:</p>

<p>Luckily, the company's only two years old, so you know, hopefully, hopefully we can continue moving in a positive direction.</p>

<p>00:21:58:</p>

<p>But the time that it takes to record this I'm currently sitting at 22 minutes, 39 seconds.</p>

<p>00:22:05:</p>

<p>I think on the actual recording, it's like 22 minutes, five seconds, something like that.</p>

<p>00:22:10:</p>

<p>But I was working on a transcription before I started doing this, and I said, You know what?</p>

<p>00:22:16:</p>

<p>I really need to get that thing done.</p>

<p>00:22:17:</p>

<p>So if I'm going to do more things like that, I need to make sure that I'm not taking away time from my family without it making sense from a from a value perspective.</p>

<p>00:22:37:</p>

<p>So what does that mean?</p>

<p>00:22:41:</p>

<p>Does that mean there's gonna be a patri on?</p>

<p>00:22:42:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:22:43:</p>

<p>Does that mean there's gonna be ah member full or something like that?</p>

<p>00:22:47:</p>

<p>No, I don't know what it means at the moment.</p>

<p>00:22:51:</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is one person.</p>

<p>00:22:56:</p>

<p>I'm looking for a couple things.</p>

<p>00:22:57:</p>

<p>I'm looking for two people to listen to this and tell me that they heard it.</p>

<p>00:23:02:</p>

<p>They enjoyed it or they heard it and they didn't enjoy it.</p>

<p>00:23:05:</p>

<p>And here's why.</p>

<p>00:23:06:</p>

<p>Or they heard it.</p>

<p>00:23:06:</p>

<p>And I'm an idiot or whatever.</p>

<p>00:23:09:</p>

<p>The other thing I want to hear is someone say I have heard this.</p>

<p>00:23:13:</p>

<p>I appreciate it.</p>

<p>00:23:15:</p>

<p>It brought me value.</p>

<p>00:23:17:</p>

<p>And I want to, in some way, shape or form compensate you for the value that you've put out.</p>

<p>00:23:27:</p>

<p>Now, if you feel like you can't afford that, by all means, I understand I'm not even saying that you have to feel obligated to give me money.</p>

<p>00:23:39:</p>

<p>I am saying that if this truly brings value to you and you feel like you would be willing to do something to ensure that this value continued to happen, I need to know, because otherwise all I'm doing is wasting my time and my energy putting something out there that no one's listening to now, the pit podcast as a whole.</p>

<p>00:24:07:</p>

<p>The interviews they will still happen because I enjoy.</p>

<p>00:24:09:</p>

<p>I enjoy the conversations.</p>

<p>00:24:12:</p>

<p>At the present time, I have five six interviews scheduled in like the next month.</p>

<p>00:24:24:</p>

<p>I can stretch those out for the remainder of the year, and that will be the entire pit season.</p>

<p>00:24:30:</p>

<p>Or I can release them on a bi weekly, maybe even weekly basis, like we used to back in the good old days.</p>

<p>00:24:40:</p>

<p>But I'm not going to do that at the stake of my sanity, knowing that it's not going to make an impact in anyone's life or knowing that the people who are consuming it are just using.</p>

<p>00:24:54:</p>

<p>It is background noise.</p>

<p>00:24:55:</p>

<p>I cannot do that.</p>

<p>00:24:57:</p>

<p>So here's the promise that I'm making today as I'm recording this and this will be released is June 10th.</p>

<p>00:25:05:</p>

<p>If by June 20th we have one pledge to somehow pay for this service, you know, pay for this podcast, not even not even monetarily.</p>

<p>00:25:21:</p>

<p>Maybe it's just in terms of like, Hey, I promise that if you put in episode, I will retweet it and I will reply with a comment.</p>

<p>00:25:30:</p>

<p>I am okay with that being the currency.</p>

<p>00:25:33:</p>

<p>I love your money.</p>

<p>00:25:34:</p>

<p>But if you don't have it, I understand.</p>

<p>00:25:37:</p>

<p>Some of us just don't have it.</p>

<p>00:25:40:</p>

<p>And if I have two people that can just say Hey, you know what?</p>

<p>00:25:44:</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>

<p>00:25:45:</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the thought piece.</p>

<p>00:25:47:</p>

<p>This is what I did like.</p>

<p>00:25:48:</p>

<p>This is what I didn't like.</p>

<p>00:25:49:</p>

<p>Maybe a little too much preaching at the end.</p>

<p>00:25:53:</p>

<p>Whatever it is.</p>

<p>00:25:55:</p>

<p>10 days.</p>

<p>00:25:57:</p>

<p>I will talk about this every single day.</p>

<p>00:25:59:</p>

<p>I will tweet it out every single day.</p>

<p>00:26:01:</p>

<p>I will give it my full up.</p>

<p>00:26:03:</p>

<p>Do a transcription for it.</p>

<p>00:26:05:</p>

<p>I will do everything possible to make sure that people hear this.</p>

<p>00:26:13:</p>

<p>And if again, two people tell me, Give me some feedback.</p>

<p>00:26:19:</p>

<p>One person pledges some type of either money or effort in terms of a currency.</p>

<p>00:26:27:</p>

<p>Then I will continue to do this and I will pledge to release the episodes that I'm recording at a bi weekly basis.</p>

<p>00:26:33:</p>

<p>Starting out if we get more than that and I feel like I can truly start doing this on a weekly basis, then by all means, that's awesome.</p>

<p>00:26:40:</p>

<p>But if not, I have to think about the effort that I'm putting in, and I have to think about the find that it's taking away from my family and things like that.</p>

<p>00:26:54:</p>

<p>I have no problem with it.</p>

<p>00:26:55:</p>

<p>My family has no problem with it, but ultimately we and by we I mean me.</p>

<p>00:27:02:</p>

<p>I I want to share this content with you, but I don't want it to fall on deaf ears, and I don't want it to just be background noise for someone's commute.</p>

<p>00:27:12:</p>

<p>I want to be something that they take in and that they value.</p>

<p>00:27:15:</p>

<p>So that's my pledge to you.</p>

<p>00:27:16:</p>

<p>Like I said, two pieces of feedback.</p>

<p>00:27:18:</p>

<p>One pledge.</p>

<p>00:27:19:</p>

<p>If you can make that happen, then the podcasts interviews will go on a biweekly schedule, and I will probably supplement the interviews with more thoughts like this, just less preachiness on the back end.</p>

<p>00:27:31:</p>

<p>But that's gonna do it for this week.</p>

<p>00:27:33:</p>

<p>I have been your, um, speaker and your hose J.</p>

<p>00:28:31:</p>

<p>I'm open to doing more things like this, whether they're a live stream, whether we're having, like, voice, call, conversation, stuff or whatever.</p>

<p>00:28:40:</p>

<p>But more than anything, I just want to make sure that people are hearing this and that people are getting something out of it.</p>

<p>00:28:46:</p>

<p>But that's gonna do it for this time.</p>

<p>00:28:49:</p>

<title>My New Job and What that Means for All the Things I Do</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>For the last 5 months<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, I've applied for many Software Engineering and Developer Advocate Roles.</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce, starting next month, I will be working with <a href="https://elastic.co">Elastic</a> as a Developer Advocate.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/brand-elastic-sop-lockup-220x130.svg" alt="elastic logo" /></p>

<h2>What About PIT?</h2>

<p>Productivity in Tech means so much to me. I've been reassured that the work that I do with PIT can continue.</p>

<p>That said, I have made the decision will not be accepting new clients while I transition into this new role.</p>

<h2>What About Your Projects?</h2>

<p>You can expect a <em>small</em> reduction in <em>new feature work</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> while I'm adjusting to the new role. All the projects that I have been working on are Open-Source (MIT Licensed). everyone is welcome to make open source contributions to them.</p>

<h2>What About Content?</h2>

<p>The blog content will continue at it's <em>irregularly-scheduled</em> pace.</p>

<p>The PIT Podcast has enough episodes lined up for the rest of the year <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>
There is no current plan to stop doing the PIT Podcast with the alternating format.</p>

<p>Elastic is aware of the other projects I co-host and has no intention in asking me to stop any of them.</p>

<p>My livestreams are currently going to continue on a 4-5 times a week pace. This could reduce if I start streaming on behalf of my employer. There are no official plans at the moment.</p>

<h2>So Why Elastic</h2>

<p>So I hope that I have shown you a little of the attitude and enviroment that Elastic presented to me. There were many amazing things about the company that made me happy to be considered for the role. But there was one thing they did very well.</p>

<p><strong>They have a successful history of hiring outside of tech.</strong></p>

<p>This opportunity came to me because of <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1292930503125823488?s=20">some wonderful people in the industry</a>. I had amazing folks on my side, and I want to make sure that I can point folks to potential opportunities as as well. I want to work with companies that see folks from outside of traditional tech as valuable as <em>classically</em> trained individuals.</p>

<p>During the interview process, I had the pleasure to talk with several people at Elastic who, before working with the company, considered themselves <em>non-techical</em>. These were people in leadership roles. This showed me people have an opportunity to grow inside the company even if they lack the history that tends to be a gate preventing people from moving up in their career.</p>

<h2>When can you See Me "At Work"?</h2>

<p>Around the same time I accepted the position, I selected to speak at the <a href="https://pygotham.tv">PyGotham Virtual Online Conference</a> to speak about <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/transcriptor">Transcriptor</a>. I will showcase how I using the Elastic Stack to make transcriptions easier for developers!</p>

<p>There is nothing to report on live-streaming, blogging, podcasting, or speaking on behalf of Elastic. There have been some conversations and there will be some opportunities. I am happy to bring my skills to the team in whatever ways they feel would make the best impact!</p>

<p>I look forward to the future with Elastic!</p>

<title>Multipotentiality vs Mindfulness</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Having many friends that are into personal productivity<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, I've come to learn about several <em>lifestyle</em> schools of thought. Many people devote to the GTD way of life, while others, like myself, have decided to reduce the number of technological dependencies in favor of a more analog lifestyle.</p>

<h2>The Mindfulness Movement</h2>

<p>Mindfulness is a growing trend in personal productivity. Many productivity YouTubers present a very worry-free lifestyle that talks about mastering languages and giving themselves personal challenges to make the question habits and vices. The success of the genre itself speaks to the power of and intrigue from others that comes from the idea that you can live a life that above all things centers on understanding and challenging the things that you are doing at any given time.</p>

<h2>What is a Multipotentialite?</h2>

<p>Renown author and speaker on the subject, Emilie Wapnik defines on <a href="https://puttylike.com/terminology/">her site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.</p>
  
  <p>It stems from the word "multipotentiality" – a psychological and educational term used to describe people who display aptitudes across multiple disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put, it's not just about doing a lot, but it's doing a lot with a higher degree of skill in each venture.</p>

<p>I've defined myself as a <em>multipotentialite</em> for the last 3 years. My passions are in podcasting, development, and community engagement.</p>

<h2>Can These Worlds Collide and <em>Should</em> They?</h2>

<p>Having defined these two areas, I begin to wonder if it is possible to even claim to both live a life that challenges each action and embrace the chaos and unique challenges of weaving in and out of passions.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/creative-female-artist-with-painted-vase-in-modern-studio-3817583.jpg" alt="person holding skulpture" /></p>

<p>The more important question, in my opinion, is not if we can, but more if we should?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>My answer to this challenge would be "to a certain degree". I do believe that there is value in uncertainty and rigidity is often the enemy of creativity<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">3</a></sup>. But I also think there is something to gain from strategically putting yourself in a position to let your creativity flourish.</p>

<h2>Making Room for Your Hats</h2>

<p>This topic of thought probably belongs in a blog post called "Multipotentiality vs Minimalism" which is something that I considered writing and but I'm not the most versed on minimalism (by choice), so I don't feel comfortable speaking on it with any level of expertise.</p>

<p>One of the biggest areas of <em>Mindfulness</em> is questioning the value and ultimately choosing to not do something. When you are a multipotentialite, you often tend to naturally collect a lot of things, as you are doing more. To make room, you may need to remove a few things both physically and mentally. </p>

<p>Our interests change over time. A multipotentialite's superpower is the ability to push their passions (however many there are) as far as possible given their constraints. By removing many of the constraints we maximize the time and energy that we can devote to the things that matter to us.</p>

<p>In some ways, this can be changing your job to one that better aligns with your current fascinations, or dialing back the amount of time we spend on one, less meaningful hobby to focus more time and energy on more impactful endeavors.</p>

<p>On the physical side, I can keep this one brief. By removing the things that aren't as important to you, you now can showcase the more valuable things. That's it. That's the tweet.</p>

<h2>Thinking about How to Live Your Best MultiPotential Life</h2>

<p>Part of the Mindfulness mentality that often gets ignored is the idea of choosing the things that you will do.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/photo-of-a-woman-thinking-941555.jpg" alt="Person with computer with paints in foreground" /></p>

<p>There is a subset of <em>multipods</em>, that aren't doing many different things <strong>at once</strong>. Many people don't consider themselves multipotentialites because they hung up their ice skates, electric guitar, and sculpting tools long ago. For many embracing the lifestyle, they can create new opportunities in old passions by finding new ways to participate. Today there are new mediums to engage in a passion and countless possibilities to work in and around an industry.</p>

<p>For me, this means connecting with developers on Twitter and inviting them onto the [Productivity in Tech Podcast] to learn more about the awesome things they are doing (Podcasting and Community Engagement). When I hear of something new, I play around with it on my stream. Often they ask me about podcasting and live-streaming and that leads to doing consultancy and editing work. Then to help reduce the amount of work that I'm doing at any time, I create tools to help those same creators.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the heart of multipotentiality, there is a need for flexibility. At the heart of mindfulness, there is a need for a lack of rigidity. 🤔 It seems like the core fundamentals of these two ways of living are the same.</p>

<title>Changes for PIT and New Projects on the Horizon</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you want to know the changes coming up, then listen to this.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/0e037bba"></iframe>

<p>Now here's the scoop. </p>

<p><strong>The PIT Podcast will be winding down.</strong> I will be releasing the remaining interviews in their raw format with the aftershow's included.</p>

<p><strong>I will be starting an audio newsletter that will be premium only, meaning you will need to pay for the audio version which will include interviews</strong>. More on that in the future as I'm trying to get the logistics of that ironed out.</p>

<p><strong>I'm working on a potential book</strong> or a really long blog post.</p>

<p><strong>My blog will get a little more buckshot</strong>. This means that I will be talking about a bunch of things.</p>

<p><strong>The newsletter will be more valuable as it will have a recap of all the things I'm working on</strong>. Please subscribe.</p>

<p><strong>My future in podcasting will be limited run shows...And maybe a show with a friend</strong> Still working on things there but safe to say new projects will be limited run seasons with other things around them.</p>

<p><strong>Taking a break with new clients for PIT</strong>. I need time to focus on my health and happiness and some of the projects that I'm working on. I will continue to make things that I want to make, but I won't be taking new clients at the moment.</p>

<title>Playing with New Technologies and with Trey Hunner</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trey spends his days training Pythonistas around the world. This means that while he can't also use the "new hotness" for everything, it's important to know how things work. Jay compares that to the new role and how it is getting him to connect and learn new things.</p>

<title>Showing the Toothfairy Icon only when my Airpods Pro are Connected</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="https://macbartender.com">Bartender 4</a> released with a couple of features that I was super stoked about. </p>

<p>One of those updates was the ability to add custom rules for showing/hiding icons based. Wanting to play with this more I created a watcher shell script for showing/hiding the <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> icon.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/ToothFairy%20Toggle.png" alt="Bartender Showing Toothfairy" /></p>

<p>The end result of this script is that when my Airpods Pro are connected to the device, the toothfairy icon will appear in the menu bar. Once the Airpods Pro are disconnected the icon will go back to being hidden. This means that I can quickly tell when my AirPods Pro are connected to my machine (even if they are also connected to my phone or iPad).</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/bartender-toothfairy-disabled.png" alt="Airpods are not connected and the icon is in the secondary Bartender Bar" /></p>

<h2>The Script</h2>

<p>I found the command for getting your Bluetooth settings just tabbing through terminal commands. </p>

<p><code>AP_STAT=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A9 "Jay’s AirPods Pro:")</code></p>

<p>This saves the information for any bluetooth device named <em>Jay's AirPods Pro</em> to <code>AP_STAT</code> (Airpods Status).</p>

<p>I got help from this similar idea from <a href="https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airpodspro-battery">Godbout's Alfred Workflow</a>. </p>

<p><code>echo $AP_STAT | awk '/Connected: Yes/{print 1}'</code></p>

<p>echo prints the data and awk is a <em>text manipulation</em> command. It looks for the pattern <code>Connnected: Yes</code> and returns a 1 if it is found (otherwise it returns nothing).</p>

<p>Bartender looks for a <em>True</em> value which <code>1</code> is. </p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/toothfairy-bartender-enabled.png" alt="Airpods are Enabled and the icon is showing in the main menubar" /></p>

<p>Here's the whole script</p>

<pre><code>AP_STAT=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A9 "Jay’s AirPods Pro:")
echo $AP_STAT | awk '/Connected: Yes/{print 1}'
</code></pre>

<p>Both <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> and <a href="https://macbartender.com">Bartender 4</a> (available on Big Sur ONLY) are both a part of <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/6bcd77a8-3223-482b-bcd2-ff337999765d">SetApp (Affiliate Link)</a></p>

<title>The &#34;Problem&#34; with rewriting tasks in your Bullet Journal</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked about the headache of re-writing things in my Bullet Journal. I have an interesting trick in fixing that. </p>

<h2>I do the task so I don't have to write it down more than once or twice.</h2>

<p>If I have to write it down more than twice, I must convince myself that is a task worth keeping. I do this by looking at how long a task will take. If less than 30 minutes, I do it on the spot.</p>

<p>This idea is like that of a Mitch Hedberg joke.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sit in a hotel and think of something funny. When I think of something,  I get a pen and pad and write it down. If I can't find a pen or pad, I convince myself that what I just thought of was not that funny<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often convince myself to do the thing instead of writing it down for the umpteenth-time. Alternatively, I strike it and say, "This isn't important".</p>

<title>Break up with your Productivity Obsession and Learning and Teaching with Jasmine Greenaway</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Jay seems to have broken up with productivity as an obsession and now he's missing the thrill of the hunt.</p>

<p>My guest this week is a Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, Brooklyn.js organizer, and lecturer, Jasmine Greenaway.</p>

<p>We talk about the benefits of coming into a role where you can learn and teach.</p>

<title>Quickly Set Your Environment with Bunch and Alfred</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/">Bunch</a> is an environment setup/teardown tool by the <a href="https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/episodes/podcast-ground-surfing-with-brett-terpstra">mad genius and yoga maestro of the internet</a> Brett Terpstra.</p>

<p>Bunch uses small configuration files to quickly manipulate your desktop environment. </p>

<p>With it you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open/Close/Focus Applications, Files, and URLs</li>
<li>Run shell and Applescript scripts to expand the functionality event more</li>
</ul>

<p>Because I prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard and the Application's main method of use is the Dock, I opted to take advantage of Bunch's URL-Scheme. </p>

<pre><code>x-bunch://open?bunch=[Bunch Name]
</code></pre>

<p>This plus smart use of the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/"><em>File Filter</em></a> in Alfred's workflow feature allowed me to quickly setup an <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Alfred Workflow</a> that not only lets you run your bunches but also lets you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Display the Config File of the Bunch.</li>
<li>Edit the Bunch in your default application.</li>
<li>Refresh your Bunches (After making a change)</li>
</ul>

<p>The workflow is available on <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/bunch-quick-launch">Packal</a> to modify via my <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/Bunch_Alfred">Github Repo</a></p>

<title>My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been on a tear with new podcasts, live streams, and communities.</p>

<p>My secret is these are all <em>cries for help</em>. </p>

<p>Not in a life threatening way, but in the stuck in an axiety induced feedback loop. </p>

<p><img src="https://questionablecontent.net/comics/3953.png" alt="Questionable Content Comic by Jeph Jacques" /></p>

<p>I've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more <em>fatalistic</em> and irrational towards things not going according to plan. </p>

<h3>Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?</h3>

<p><em>HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW</em></p>

<p>It just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. </p>

<p>I will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.</p>

<h3>Why are you telling us this?</h3>

<p>I'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. </p>

<p>It took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>

<p>I understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. </p>

<title>My Life is a Tetris Board</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Your friend ADHD Tech Worker here to admit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I may I'm addicted to work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When was the last time you tried to not think about things for a bit? I don't mean playing meditation music and trying to relax.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm referring to the idea of saying I have enough going on right now and I don't want to put more on myself. I'm often neglecting projects because I have other projects waiting. I'm almost always thinking, "I need to do something to prepare for this so I will sit these other things down to focus on this thing over here".</p>

<p>As I'm writing this. I can think of several things that I need to do instead. Here's a sample:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record the Audio/Video for the PIT Show</li>
<li>Clean up the code around my blog</li>
<li>Do some work on <em>Transcriptor</em></li>
<li>Do some work on <em>Render Engine</em></li>
<li>Do some work on <a href="https://diversityorgs.tech">diversityorgs.tech</a></li>
<li>Do some work on <a href="https://writeuglycode.com">writeuglycode.com</a></li>
<li>Edit and finish another blog post</li>
<li>Clean my bedroom</li>
</ul>

<p>But instead I'm writing you. </p>

<p>Sure finish this, I may open my notebook or a digital project manager and think about the best way to tackle any of these projects. Or I'll play Tetris. Tetris seems to have the same level of brain activity (or work) with less of the stakes. In fact my life is analogous to a game of Tetris where I'm constantly trying to spin activities and place them strategically in my life until I either fill the board (burn out) or complete a line (project) and open a little more space for the next batch of shapes. </p>

<p>Of the next piece is coming. I should probably do something with it.</p>

<title>How I Made My Twitch Player Appear on My Site Only When I&#39;m Live</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to write this to show that the easiest answer can often elude us. </p>

<p>If I asked you to add a twitch frame to a website and make it only appear when you were live, how would you do it?</p>

<h2>Embedding the Twitch Frame</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything">documentation</a> from Twitch, I copied the example code, adjusted the width and the height<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and changed the <code>channel-id</code> to my Twitch username.</p>

<h2>Checking the Live Status</h2>

<p>After spending an hour on stream trying to build a twitch app, I opted for the more low-tech solution. </p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getPlayerState</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">currentTime</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#twitch-block&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">display</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;initial&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#twitch-block&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">display</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;None&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There were a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The javascript was easy.</li>
<li>The authentication stuff is hard to stream (in a secure way)</li>
<li>RateLimits and things</li>
<li>THE JAVASCRIPT WAS EASY</li>
</ul>

<p>The hardest part about building this listener was keeping it simple. You could add event listeners and things and you could use webhooks and all that stuff. Another option is to look at the <code>currentTime</code> value. When you are not streaming, <code>player.getPlayerState().currentTime == 0</code><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. This means that I can set  <code>display="None"</code> on the element that holds the twitch player. Allowing my website to act like the embed was never there<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Don't forget to add an amazing purple background so it looks fantastic!</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/purple-background-twitch-embed.png" alt="embed with a beautiful background" /></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Which I still a little confused on how that present in a responsive way&#160;<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-2">
<p>I don't know if this is the case if you are hosting someone sooooo... Your mileage may vary.&#160;<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-3">
<p>There could be some performance issues with this, but ultimately if there is the player would not load which means that the block wouldn't take up any space.&#160;<a href="#fnref-3" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

<title>Pigeons are Scary</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Let me first say that [Questionable Content] is hands down my favorite online comic and I've been following them for more than a decade now and have viewed EVERY SINGLE STRIP.</p>

<p>Every once in a while there is a strip that speaks to me in a profound way. Monday's post did just that.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Shared-Image-2019-08-06-10-47-21.png" alt="The key point of Monday's Strip" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passion is scary, pigeons aren't.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the fact that pigeons are the rats of the sky (don't at me). There is something profound with the idea of doing things for the sake of the norm.</p>

<p>For years, the idea of PIT was to get into podcasting and scratch an itch. Every time I wanted to take things to the next level, I would let things start to fade off because the potential growth was scary.</p>

<p>I would start with so much vigor but then things would dwindle and I would make the excuse that I just wasn't interested in that thing anymore.</p>

<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/26FLaMSr33JCqbGRW/giphy.gif" alt="Lying to myself" /></p>

<p>If I were honest, it was because I was scared.</p>

<p>In fact even in PIT's rebirth it went from being a way to help developers be more productive with coaching into a pivot to content editing because the apparent <em>lack</em>of<em>demand</em> was scary.</p>

<p>My daughter, wife and I watched <em>Tangled</em> over the weekend. There is a wonderful scene where Repunzel asks a group of thugs, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTuwo_TqlhQ">Haven't you ever had a dream?</a>"</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTuwo_TqlhQ</p>

<p>I've lost many dreams due to fear. I've instead looked at the pigeons out my window and tried to convince myself that would be enough for me.</p>

<p>It's true that my current position is a dream that came from fear. Still, it is a dream. I want to help developers create wonderful content for other developers.</p>

<p>I was terrified that I wouldn't see success and now that I have a marginal bit of success, IT's EVEN MORE TERRIFYING.</p>

<p>That said if I use that excuse as a way not to run my business (my way) I will never see that dream come to life. I'm not saying I should throw caution to the wind. I just think I should check both ways and then cross the street to get to where I've been wanting to get to for the past 6 years!</p>

Tomorrow's Post will be the regular update as usual. The blog portion of the Render Engine that I'm building (Now in testing) is still a little wonky so I wanted to share this here. This post will eventually be added to the blog.</p>

<title>BIPOCIT Dev Advocates Awesome List</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an episode of the <a href="/blog/surfacing-the-type-of-content-you-want-to-see-part-2-with-trey-hunner">PIT Show</a>, I mentioned building an awesome list for <strong>BIPOC</strong> (Black, Indigenous &amp;&amp; People of Color) people in tech. I have created the list and I plan to do a lot to surface many of the folks on this list are doing.</p>

<title>Markup Tools Always On and Keyboar Maestros Detected Image Problem</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been hoping to support more folks by creating Keyboard Maestro automations. I've been helping a few fellow podcasters. The latest request included an automation that makes the Markup menu in <em>Preview</em> "Always On". </p>

<p>To my knowledge, you can't make the Markup toolbar always available in Preview. You can, however, trigger the Markup toolbar based on state. </p>

<h2>How did I do this?</h2>

<p>This was a quick automation (my favorite type of automation).</p>

<p>It uses the <em>Found Image Condition</em> to check if the Markup toolbar is enabled. If it is then do nothing. Otherwise, Trigger the hotkey. Have this automation fire whenever <em>Preview</em> activates.</p>

<p><img src="../../../Desktop/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Detected%20Image%20Problem/75001D5E-C5BE-491E-B912-1DED5D5E41C1.tiff" alt="update tags" /></p>

<p>I then added a little delay (0.3 seconds) to make sure that the window had time to fully load.</p>

<h2>This worked! Until it didn't!</h2>

<p>I was happy to see this working well but when I shared it, I got a very unexpected reply. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This isn't working for me!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What could be wrong with a three action command? I spent time troubleshooting and finally after getting a video from the requestor, I saw a big problem. They weren't using dark mode.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h2>This is a new problem</h2>

<p>The whole purpose of automation is that consistency is key. While there was a temporary solution to just create a version that likes light mode. But that's not an elegant solution. There should be a way to change what an icon would look like </p>

<p>You can download the final version that supports both Light/Dark Mode via this <a href="https://gist.github.com/kjaymiller/b4d8b33bfadb57a87b3247bf441ba72b#file-always-show-markup-window-kmmacros">GitHub Gist</a>.</p>

<title>PIT Reflections: The Spiral to free Content</title>  <description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/8568b432"></iframe>

<p>Your Boy got a JOB! Next month begins my career as a developer advocate, but we don't talk about that too much. </p>

<p>I had a conversation with a friend where we talked about the race to the bottom with content creation becoming more and more free. I talk about the ups and downs of this.</p>

<h2>Transcription:</h2>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>What's up, everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:20:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:00:20:</p>

<p>Miller here back with a reflection, this time for the 18th of August 2 20.</p>

<p>00:00:29:</p>

<p>And this is a very interesting one.</p>

<p>00:00:32:</p>

<p>This is what we're recording.</p>

<p>00:00:33:</p>

<p>Live on, Twitch.</p>

<p>00:00:35:</p>

<p>If you want to catch that, then you need to make sure following on twitch.</p>

<p>00:00:40:</p>

<p>So we got a lot to talk about.</p>

<p>00:00:42:</p>

<p>Let's just jump right into this and we're going to start with the biggest news.</p>

<p>00:00:49:</p>

<p>Yeah, I got a job.</p>

<p>00:00:55:</p>

<p>I am officially going to be working as a developer advocate for elastic search.</p>

<p>00:01:03:</p>

<p>Um, I believe the last time we talked about this, I was like, Right there.</p>

<p>00:01:08:</p>

<p>I think I had, like, one more interview left, right?</p>

<p>00:01:10:</p>

<p>Just had the final interview and had to negotiate and do all that stuff.</p>

<p>00:01:16:</p>

<p>So we are now developer advocates.</p>

<p>00:01:20:</p>

<p>And for people who have been following the journey of productivity and tech and my personal journey, you'll know that this has been a thing that I have been working towards for the last 56 years.</p>

<p>00:01:38:</p>

<p>So I want to take the second half of this conversation to talk about something that I came up in a conversation that I had with another content creator earlier today.</p>

<p>00:01:53:</p>

<p>As I'm recording this, I'm recording this on the 17 that will come out on the 18th.</p>

<p>00:01:57:</p>

<p>Uh, I was watching this person live stream, and they were talking about wanting to consolidate some of the things that they were doing and put them all under different tiers of support.</p>

<p>00:02:11:</p>

<p>Now, people that are familiar with pit know that one of you want to give me money.</p>

<p>00:02:17:</p>

<p>I'm not going to stop you.</p>

<p>00:02:19:</p>

<p>But I am terrible at asking for money.</p>

<p>00:02:23:</p>

<p>I'm terrible at providing value that I feel warrants people giving me money.</p>

<p>00:02:30:</p>

<p>That's just something that I have always struggled with presenting.</p>

<p>00:02:39:</p>

<p>However, I also feel like the things that I do are valuable.</p>

<p>00:02:47:</p>

<p>And I let people know if you want me to continue to do those things, there has to be some form of value conveyed so that I can continue to pay to do those things Now.</p>

<p>00:03:05:</p>

<p>To me, that looks like some really fun stuff that looks like me, you know, doing open mic stuff with some of my people, some of the people in the community, or just sit there and having conversations with them for hours on end or you re tweeting and showcasing some of the awesome things that they're doing.</p>

<p>00:03:27:</p>

<p>It could be getting on a stream like this and recording.</p>

<p>00:03:31:</p>

<p>You know, my podcast episodes live and doing all these things.</p>

<p>00:03:36:</p>

<p>But there was a conversation in the conversation.</p>

<p>00:03:40:</p>

<p>We talked about the idea of content creation moving ever and ever closer to where everything was expected to be free.</p>

<p>00:03:53:</p>

<p>And as much as I want Teoh complain about that, he's right.</p>

<p>00:04:02:</p>

<p>All my content available for free.</p>

<p>00:04:05:</p>

<p>I don't even my premiums show is free.</p>

<p>00:04:08:</p>

<p>Yes, you got to do something.</p>

<p>00:04:10:</p>

<p>You gotta sign up for my newsletter, which I mean Newsletter will also go out when this goes out.</p>

<p>00:04:15:</p>

<p>So there's that.</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>But if you want bonus content, you don't have to give up anything monetarily for it.</p>

<p>00:04:25:</p>

<p>And in a way, this is a good and bad thing, and I think that it's happening for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<p>00:04:39:</p>

<p>So I'm gonna outlined the reasons first, and then I'll explain why I think it's both a good and a bad thing.</p>

<p>00:04:45:</p>

<p>The reason is it's cheaper and cheaper to make content, and the demand for quality content is going down.</p>

<p>00:04:54:</p>

<p>If you look at education traditional If you go back 20 years ago, if you wanted toe learn something, you had to spend good money.</p>

<p>00:05:09:</p>

<p>And depending on what it was, you might have to pay a lot more.</p>

<p>00:05:13:</p>

<p>Programming books were like 60 70 $80 at Barnes and Noble.</p>

<p>00:05:18:</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure they still are.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>You can get an online course for 10 bucks a month.</p>

<p>00:05:27:</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>

<p>00:05:28:</p>

<p>You can get hundreds of courses for $10 a month.</p>

<p>00:05:35:</p>

<p>Why, though Well, because it's easier to mill, it's easier to say I'm going to do a thing.</p>

<p>00:05:41:</p>

<p>I'm going to follow the steps and in marketing terms, I'm gonna turkey carve content so that I'm making more and more content easier and easier with less and less effort.</p>

<p>00:05:53:</p>

<p>And here's an example of that.</p>

<p>00:05:56:</p>

<p>I did a coaching course over the weekend with a client of mine, and in that course we talked about a few things over the span of about three hours.</p>

<p>00:06:09:</p>

<p>In that time, I came out with about five different block post topics with screenshots and a video that I could go back and look at and so many other features so many other things that I could use to generate more content already had the video set up.</p>

<p>00:06:31:</p>

<p>I already had.</p>

<p>00:06:32:</p>

<p>The Screenshots already had the links and references.</p>

<p>00:06:34:</p>

<p>I already had the research.</p>

<p>00:06:37:</p>

<p>I could just turn all that stuff out like butter if I wanted to.</p>

<p>00:06:43:</p>

<p>That's what I mean as we're doing things.</p>

<p>00:06:46:</p>

<p>The things that we're doing can be reused and recycled in my talk that I'm going to be giving it pie.</p>

<p>00:06:52:</p>

<p>Gotham I quote a talk that I gave last year as the explainer for why this talk was even necessary as an explainer for why the entire platform that I created was necessary.</p>

<p>00:07:06:</p>

<p>I didn't have to do a bunch of market research.</p>

<p>00:07:08:</p>

<p>I didn't have to dio a bunch of testing, and I didn't have to pay a bunch of money to host on my code, my storage and make everything happen.</p>

<p>00:07:16:</p>

<p>Now I'm paying a little bit, but in the future, that's actually gonna be free as well.</p>

<p>00:07:21:</p>

<p>So, through all of this, I'm able Teoh really expand the scope of what I'm capable of doing for much less so.</p>

<p>00:07:37:</p>

<p>Like I said, it's easier to create content content to be created faster and it requires a lot less work and energy, and the people that are doing it at the highest level are still going to excel because of the calibre of content and the quality of content that they're putting out.</p>

<p>00:07:53:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:07:55:</p>

<p>Is this a bad thing?</p>

<p>00:07:58:</p>

<p>In short, No.</p>

<p>00:08:00:</p>

<p>No, it's not.</p>

<p>00:08:01:</p>

<p>And here's why.</p>

<p>00:08:05:</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, part of what got me hired onto elastic was a skill set that I developed over time and gave away for free.</p>

<p>00:08:18:</p>

<p>So if you look at my salary and it may be a bad way to equate the value of this, but if you go back and you look at what I've been able to get to in terms of a salary over five years, if you look at where I started, I have doubled close to doubled.</p>

<p>00:08:38:</p>

<p>Haven't double quite yet, but I'm close to doubled.</p>

<p>00:08:41:</p>

<p>What I am, what I was making when I started in the tech industry in seven years, I almost doubled what I was able to do, all because of the things that I did for free in my off time.</p>

<p>00:09:00:</p>

<p>So for me to make those things for free was a net positive in my book now, Do I feel like content should be given away for free?</p>

<p>00:09:15:</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>00:09:17:</p>

<p>Some content?</p>

<p>00:09:17:</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of content.</p>

<p>00:09:19:</p>

<p>No, I don't think ab should be free.</p>

<p>00:09:23:</p>

<p>In general, I think that giving away an app means that you are selling something else.</p>

<p>00:09:29:</p>

<p>You're making that money back some way.</p>

<p>00:09:32:</p>

<p>Unless you're doing what you know a few of my friends have in building a thing to learn about it.</p>

<p>00:09:38:</p>

<p>In fact, most of people that I know that have built a thing just to learn how to do that thing, actually sell that thing that they made that learning until they sell it.</p>

<p>00:09:48:</p>

<p>Because they understand that there was a work that went into it.</p>

<p>00:09:50:</p>

<p>So they want to get value back for the work that they put in.</p>

<p>00:09:53:</p>

<p>That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>00:09:58:</p>

<p>Is it free for me to podcasts?</p>

<p>00:09:59:</p>

<p>No, it's not happy hosting peas.</p>

<p>00:10:03:</p>

<p>Ah, take time away from my family like I am right now.</p>

<p>00:10:06:</p>

<p>I do a lot, Teoh and pay a lot to do the things that I do streaming this.</p>

<p>00:10:19:</p>

<p>I had to buy a whole new computer last year so I could stream because when I tried streaming on my other devices.</p>

<p>00:10:27:</p>

<p>They just crashed and they shut down this whole set up that I have this microphone that I have the audio interface, everything else.</p>

<p>00:10:37:</p>

<p>This is thousands of dollars that I've invested into this.</p>

<p>00:10:41:</p>

<p>Now you would say that those air probably good investments, but they were investments nonetheless, so it doesn't make sense to me to create a thing for free.</p>

<p>00:10:54:</p>

<p>However, I knew strategically what I was doing and that I was going to get paid for it eventually.</p>

<p>00:11:01:</p>

<p>And now I can happily say, like for the last three or four years, productivity in tech podcast has paid for itself.</p>

<p>00:11:09:</p>

<p>We have people that support the show at a high enough level that I don't have to pay any money to host it.</p>

<p>00:11:17:</p>

<p>Between the work that I do outside of the client work that I pick up in all of those things, I'm effectively getting it for free.</p>

<p>00:11:31:</p>

<p>That said to the people who are making something and hoping to give it away for free and still make a living off of it.</p>

<p>00:11:41:</p>

<p>You have to know what the planets my plan was to do the bed podcast for free in hopes that one day someone would pay me to podcast for them.</p>

<p>00:11:55:</p>

<p>And like I said, I'm not there yet, But I'm hoping that soon enough that will be happening.</p>

<p>00:11:59:</p>

<p>Now I'm in a position to where that can possibly happen.</p>

<p>00:12:07:</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there that are making content for free that don't have a monetization strategy.</p>

<p>00:12:17:</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there that are doing something for free and hoping to turn it into something that they can get big enough on and make a bunch of money off of eventually.</p>

<p>00:12:31:</p>

<p>Here's what I have to say to those people.</p>

<p>00:12:35:</p>

<p>It is much easier to look at what you have.</p>

<p>00:12:42:</p>

<p>Look at the people it brings value to and ask them to support your work now, not with the promise that you will do anything outside of what you're already doing, but just for the sake of supporting your existing work.</p>

<p>00:13:05:</p>

<p>It is much easier to ask them now for support, and you'll most likely receive some form of support from those people that get value from what you're doing.</p>

<p>00:13:16:</p>

<p>It may not be a ton, but it may be a little long term listeners.</p>

<p>00:13:22:</p>

<p>The pit will know that there used to be a Facebook group that had thousands of people in it, that we're all part of the productivity and tech Facebook group.</p>

<p>00:13:31:</p>

<p>I gave up that group to start a small private community where people had to pay to get access to it.</p>

<p>00:13:41:</p>

<p>It didn't promise them any bells and whistles.</p>

<p>00:13:42:</p>

<p>All it promised them was a chat room where they could connect with me on a regular basis.</p>

<p>00:13:46:</p>

<p>And since then that community is now free again.</p>

<p>00:13:49:</p>

<p>And the only people that really talking it are the people that still give me money to support what I'm doing.</p>

<p>00:13:58:</p>

<p>The people that signed up for that there were a total of eight people, and I'm still friends with all of those eight people.</p>

<p>00:14:10:</p>

<p>Those eight people provided 800 times more revenue, more profit and on a budget that made it a lot easier for me to do podcasting, then a group of thousands of people who were listening Teoh the pope, reading the posts and liking and doing all that stuff, and it was so much easier to please those eight people than it was to create, engaging and enlightening content for 2000 people, and that's why I'm saying, Look at your existing audience, figure out how much value you're bringing to them and ask, and if they can't do it, they can't do it.</p>

<p>00:15:03:</p>

<p>But I think the reason that people are rushing to the bottom for free content is because they have to rely on a numbers game that is unfair to creators.</p>

<p>00:15:18:</p>

<p>They're having to push hundreds of thousands of people consuming their content.</p>

<p>00:15:23:</p>

<p>They have to create content instead of creating the content that they want to create in the content that they enjoy creating.</p>

<p>00:15:29:</p>

<p>They have to now make content with the thought of.</p>

<p>00:15:33:</p>

<p>Is this going to generate an audience?</p>

<p>00:15:36:</p>

<p>Is this going to generate traffic?</p>

<p>00:15:38:</p>

<p>Is this going to make what I'm doing appealing to advertisers?</p>

<p>00:15:49:</p>

<p>I don't like the direction that we're going in, and I don't want people to feel like productivity And tech is Go is helping promote that kind of business model.</p>

<p>00:16:12:</p>

<p>I said a long time ago it won't have ads on it.</p>

<p>00:16:15:</p>

<p>The podcast itself won't have, adds.</p>

<p>00:16:18:</p>

<p>The newsletter might have ads.</p>

<p>00:16:20:</p>

<p>I might give shoutouts, but I'm not gonna do ads.</p>

<p>00:16:25:</p>

<p>My website might have ads.</p>

<p>00:16:27:</p>

<p>The website.</p>

<p>00:16:28:</p>

<p>I'm sorry, However, right now I'm not trying to align myself any particular pathway that has me selling clicks for pennies.</p>

<p>00:16:42:</p>

<p>I'm not in the business of selling clicks for pennies.</p>

<p>00:16:45:</p>

<p>I'm just not.</p>

<p>00:16:46:</p>

<p>I don't have time for that.</p>

<p>00:16:47:</p>

<p>I don't have the energy for that.</p>

<p>00:16:49:</p>

<p>If I were doing a podcast with someone else, there might be a different conversation.</p>

<p>00:16:55:</p>

<p>But in regards to the pit podcast, it is not in the business of trading clicks or listens for pins.</p>

<p>00:17:06:</p>

<p>However, productivity in tech has always and will always be my playground.</p>

<p>00:17:13:</p>

<p>It will be the thing that I do for fun.</p>

<p>00:17:15:</p>

<p>It will be the thing that I do because I enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>00:17:18:</p>

<p>And I hope that over monetization of a platform that I am able to encourage, inspire and enlightened folks on a pathway to be more productive in whatever it is they're doing.</p>

<p>00:17:33:</p>

<p>That is the goal of productivity intact with the business, the podcast, the brand, all of those things.</p>

<p>00:17:41:</p>

<p>I hope that I've been doing that.</p>

<p>00:17:44:</p>

<p>If I haven't, please call me out, and I will try to course correct bunts.</p>

<p>00:17:51:</p>

<p>Just because I give this away for free doesn't mean that your information is being sold.</p>

<p>00:18:01:</p>

<p>It doesn't mean that I'm tracking you.</p>

<p>00:18:04:</p>

<p>In fact, I have aligned the podcast with organizations and companies and hosting that doesn't track.</p>

<p>00:18:15:</p>

<p>They track information for me.</p>

<p>00:18:19:</p>

<p>And while I will peak at it from time to time, that those numbers don't go anywhere, they don't go to anybody.</p>

<p>00:18:29:</p>

<p>And the people that are hosting it aren't using it.</p>

<p>00:18:31:</p>

<p>They're not selling that information.</p>

<p>00:18:33:</p>

<p>They can.</p>

<p>00:18:33:</p>

<p>It's our assess its It's like MP threes, and that's why I don't have, you know, adds auto generated into this show and all those things.</p>

<p>00:18:41:</p>

<p>And there's again nothing wrong with the people that are doing that.</p>

<p>00:18:46:</p>

<p>I am choosing not to do that.</p>

<p>00:18:49:</p>

<p>So this has been my little rant in that area.</p>

<p>00:18:52:</p>

<p>Like I said, I don't really have any particular point.</p>

<p>00:18:57:</p>

<p>I just want you also think about where content creation is going.</p>

<p>00:19:06:</p>

<p>I see a lot of people now that we're creating what's called premium content where you can't even get access to the basic level of content without paying for it.</p>

<p>00:19:14:</p>

<p>That's a very interesting model.</p>

<p>00:19:16:</p>

<p>You have to have a large audience beforehand to do that.</p>

<p>00:19:21:</p>

<p>I think it will work for some.</p>

<p>00:19:24:</p>

<p>I don't think it'll work for me, but I am excited to see that people are still trying to figure out how they can create content that is scalable monetarily but also protective of the consumer's rights.</p>

<p>00:19:47:</p>

<p>All right, so let's wrap this up.</p>

<p>00:19:49:</p>

<p>What we got coming up next next week, I have an interview with someone that I've been listening to their podcast since like Day One, they come out of the same camp is like Tom Merritt and those folks.</p>

<p>00:20:03:</p>

<p>It's not going to be a technical interview.</p>

<p>00:20:04:</p>

<p>It's gonna be a really fun conversation that I had with someone that I've been wanting to talk to you for years.</p>

<p>00:20:11:</p>

<p>So I am stoked that it finally got toe happen.</p>

<p>00:20:14:</p>

<p>I can't wait to go back and edit it, because I get to listen to it again.</p>

<p>00:20:18:</p>

<p>You know, that's that's like the best part of doing these shows is that I get to record them, some having the conversation as it's happening organically.</p>

<p>00:20:25:</p>

<p>Then I get to go back and listen to it before everyone else does, and then afterwards I gotta listen to it again just to make sure I didn't screw anything up.</p>

<p>00:20:31:</p>

<p>And every time I listen to it, every time I hear the conversation or as it's happening, I pick up on something new and I learned something new.</p>

<p>00:20:39:</p>

<p>So it's like it's super awesome to have opportunities like that coming out.</p>

<p>00:20:46:</p>

<p>So, yeah, I'm gonna like I said, I have that interview coming out next week.</p>

<p>00:20:50:</p>

<p>I am doing the last interviews for the rest of the year, this week and next week.</p>

<p>00:20:56:</p>

<p>So I get to kind of relax going into this new role where I'm only having to create content for the reflection side of things and not for the actual like, Oh, we're doing a podcast interview thing where I got to bring people in.</p>

<p>00:21:13:</p>

<p>I might do some more interviews with people if I want to, but there's no requirement to.</p>

<p>00:21:19:</p>

<p>And if I do, I'll let you know, and we'll figure it out on all those things.</p>

<p>00:21:25:</p>

<p>So that's gonna be it for this reflection and ran a little bit longer because I started rambling people watching live.</p>

<p>00:21:34:</p>

<p>Thank you for hanging out.</p>

<p>00:21:36:</p>

<p>I had to have the fan running behind me because I was sweating something terrible.</p>

<p>00:21:41:</p>

<p>But thank you to the live audience listening.</p>

<p>00:21:45:</p>

<p>If you want to be a part of that live audience, you can follow me on switch.</p>

<p>00:21:47:</p>

<p>I always announce what?</p>

<p>00:21:49:</p>

<p>I'm going live and you can follow me on Twitter.</p>

<p>00:21:54:</p>

<p>That's where I do a lot of those announcements.</p>

<p>00:21:56:</p>

<p>If you're looking at my website right now, KJ why Miller?</p>

<p>00:21:59:</p>

<p>Thank you so much for that.</p>

<p>00:22:00:</p>

<p>Of course, you can catch all the things happening for productivity and tech it productivity intact dot com You can follow them on Twitter, prod, underscore and underscore Tech And last but not least thank you to an eight year old Wally for the use of his music hustler.</p>

<p>00:22:15:</p>

<p>In spite of myself for the intro and Outro folks, I'm excited.</p>

<p>00:22:21:</p>

<p>The rest of the year is gonna be a legit.</p>

<p>00:22:23:</p>

<p>It's gonna be awesome.</p>

<p>00:22:24:</p>

<p>I cannot wait for all the things that I get to do in this new role and how that's point to benefit me as a podcaster so I can bring that value back to this show.</p>

<p>00:22:39:</p>

<p>I am stuff I'm pumped That's going to do it for this week.</p>

<p>00:22:44:</p>

<p>I hope we've been productive.</p>

<p>00:22:46:</p>

<p>I'm Jay Miller.</p>

<h1>Transcript</h1>

<p>00:00:19:</p>

<p>What is up everybody?</p>

<p>00:00:21:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:00:21:</p>

<p>Miller here back with another productivity in tech reflection.</p>

<p>00:00:26:</p>

<p>The 1st 1 for the month of August.</p>

<p>00:00:32:</p>

<p>Oh, boy, it has been quite a month.</p>

<p>00:00:36:</p>

<p>Quite quite quite a month, I guess.</p>

<p>00:00:43:</p>

<p>Technically, it hasn't been quite a month because it's only been a few days in, but July was busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy and we're gonna get into that.</p>

<p>00:00:54:</p>

<p>But we're also gonna be talking about some of the other things going on around the world of pit in my world, in all of the things that I've been noticing, a little bit of news and some other stuff.</p>

<p>00:01:13:</p>

<p>So let's let's jump right in.</p>

<p>00:01:17:</p>

<p>Let's catch up here.</p>

<p>00:01:19:</p>

<p>The how is July for me shall I was busy, so I was, like, stupid busy.</p>

<p>00:01:26:</p>

<p>Ah, I did a lot of things.</p>

<p>00:01:27:</p>

<p>In July, I gave a couple of talks, one for the Mac Stock Expo in which I talked about playing for profit, which basically was the idea of creating Elaine for yourself by having fun and then being able to financially sustain yourself from that lane that you've created.</p>

<p>00:01:58:</p>

<p>I also gave a talk.</p>

<p>00:02:01:</p>

<p>Ah, local meet up at San Diego Python call the Working with files and high test Um, I There's a huge bag story behind that.</p>

<p>00:02:12:</p>

<p>But long story short, I thought that the pie test testing framework worked one way in a certain area.</p>

<p>00:02:25:</p>

<p>But turns out it doesn't.</p>

<p>00:02:27:</p>

<p>And I did a little deep dive into that and then basically revealed my findings in about a 12 minute talk.</p>

<p>00:02:37:</p>

<p>But what else did we dio?</p>

<p>00:02:39:</p>

<p>We guest on a couple of shows.</p>

<p>00:02:44:</p>

<p>Um, neither one of them are out yet.</p>

<p>00:02:46:</p>

<p>So your ears peeled in your eyes, appealed for you know those announcements, I will share that information on my website, as well as on Twitter and microdot blawg whenever things go live.</p>

<p>00:03:06:</p>

<p>But, yeah, I had a blast talking with the hosts, and I don't get to be on other shows very often.</p>

<p>00:03:17:</p>

<p>So when I am, I'm, like, super pumped on.</p>

<p>00:03:21:</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, I don't remember the first.</p>

<p>00:03:25:</p>

<p>But when I did the first interview, I'm pretty sure it was either in late June or early early July.</p>

<p>00:03:35:</p>

<p>So I may have done three guest appearances this past month, which is just a lot for me.</p>

<p>00:03:49:</p>

<p>No, something that I was wondering whether or not I should talk about publicly, but ultimately decided that I will, because I think it's important.</p>

<p>00:04:09:</p>

<p>But I took a few interviews this month, and what does that look like?</p>

<p>00:04:17:</p>

<p>Oh, boy, I will say, for one.</p>

<p>00:04:21:</p>

<p>The interview process for software engineering or software development or developer advocacy.</p>

<p>00:04:29:</p>

<p>All those things.</p>

<p>00:04:31:</p>

<p>The process is a very, very long, then tiring, especially if you're already employed.</p>

<p>00:04:42:</p>

<p>I am fortunate to be in a position to where I can take an interview and kind of not worry as much because I am act, you know, actively employed.</p>

<p>00:04:58:</p>

<p>I think that more than anything, employers want to see what you have to offer, not on paper buds out loud.</p>

<p>00:05:21:</p>

<p>And I could talk about this as a deep dive and say, like, Oh, hey, you want to be practicing out out?</p>

<p>00:05:28:</p>

<p>I think that there's a lot of value in that.</p>

<p>00:05:30:</p>

<p>I think there's a lot of value and letting people see the process.</p>

<p>00:05:33:</p>

<p>In fact, that's why they do coding like coating interviews like the coding challenge stuff where they say, Oh, hey, we want you to solve this problem.</p>

<p>00:05:42:</p>

<p>But remember, it's more about how you solve the problem.</p>

<p>00:05:45:</p>

<p>Not necessarily that you solve the problem like they want to see the process.</p>

<p>00:05:50:</p>

<p>They don't want to necessarily just see a solution.</p>

<p>00:05:53:</p>

<p>So that said, I feel very fortunate because people approach to me based on the things that I was already doing.</p>

<p>00:06:07:</p>

<p>So it became Hey, we see what you're doing.</p>

<p>00:06:11:</p>

<p>Do you want to do that thing for our company instead of Hey, I see you're you're looking for work.</p>

<p>00:06:19:</p>

<p>Can you explain to me why you would be a good fit?</p>

<p>00:06:22:</p>

<p>It was like here.</p>

<p>00:06:23:</p>

<p>We already know you would be a good fit.</p>

<p>00:06:25:</p>

<p>Or at least we have a really good idea that you would be a good fit.</p>

<p>00:06:28:</p>

<p>So how do we go through this song and dance of the recruiting process to one.</p>

<p>00:06:35:</p>

<p>Verify that.</p>

<p>00:06:36:</p>

<p>Verify that.</p>

<p>00:06:37:</p>

<p>You know, this stuff that you're doing on a regular isn't just some flu gets.</p>

<p>00:06:41:</p>

<p>It's something that you're able to do.</p>

<p>00:06:42:</p>

<p>It's gonna be something that's able to be translated into the job.</p>

<p>00:06:51:</p>

<p>But the only way I was able to have those conversations was by practicing out loud by having these conversations with virtually myself and sharing it out with the world for whoever would decide to listen.</p>

<p>00:07:06:</p>

<p>And that's what one of the things that I talked about in my Mac stock talk was, even if you know that it isn't the best, even if you know that there aren't a ton of people watching, treat it like a Children's recital.</p>

<p>00:07:26:</p>

<p>Allow yourself to look a little goofy, allow yourself toe, learn from those around you and take that information and publicly improve because people want to work with people who have the ability to improve.</p>

<p>00:07:44:</p>

<p>And just because you couldn't do a thing now doesn't mean that you won't always be able to do that.</p>

<p>00:07:51:</p>

<p>You'll be able to do that thing eventually, with enough working and maybe a little bit of advice, a little bit of documentation reading, you'll be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>00:08:00:</p>

<p>In fact, that's one of the things about streaming at night, which is something we will talk about in a second.</p>

<p>00:08:05:</p>

<p>That has been kind of a challenge for me because I struggle to learn new things when I'm tired, like most people.</p>

<p>00:08:17:</p>

<p>So if I've worked, you know, full shift.</p>

<p>00:08:24:</p>

<p>If I worked a full shift and then all of a sudden I am also now streaming and trying to perform and trying to learn all of these things at the same time.</p>

<p>00:08:38:</p>

<p>Then I often struggle with the ability to do that when usually I wind up going to bed, not having solved the issue, waking up and then solving it within the first couple of hours in the day.</p>

<p>00:08:54:</p>

<p>So there's something to say about.</p>

<p>00:08:55:</p>

<p>I probably could even just flip my streams, wake up early and do like super early warning streams when I'm like first waking up, get some coffee and me and I'm ready to go.</p>

<p>00:09:06:</p>

<p>But I don't see that working out for my sleep schedule as well as I don't see my family appreciating that very much because, you know, we have these hardwood floors.</p>

<p>00:09:17:</p>

<p>It's an older house, they creek.</p>

<p>00:09:19:</p>

<p>I would have basically be waking up everyone, and that's never good.</p>

<p>00:09:26:</p>

<p>But all that to say the interview process still has its quirks.</p>

<p>00:09:38:</p>

<p>I will say that I have been lucky in that I have had people on my team promoting the crap out of me, saying like, Hey, you know this person is an amazing developer.</p>

<p>00:09:49:</p>

<p>This prison is an amazing person you should totally higher in like I've had.</p>

<p>00:09:53:</p>

<p>I've had, like, a street team out there working.</p>

<p>00:09:56:</p>

<p>And for those listening that are on that street team, thank you so much.</p>

<p>00:10:00:</p>

<p>Even if I get hired, keep it up.</p>

<p>00:10:01:</p>

<p>Because, I mean, I think that it's one of those things, like the more more people that air, seeing the results, the fruits of our labor, the more and more will be able to not only help me but help others that are in the same position.</p>

<p>00:10:15:</p>

<p>I would love for people to come to me, saying, Oh, hey, by the way, are you looking for a job?</p>

<p>00:10:19:</p>

<p>But I can say no.</p>

<p>00:10:20:</p>

<p>But I know of some people that are looking that would make great hires based on the work that I've seen them put in.</p>

<p>00:10:31:</p>

<p>So yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>00:10:32:</p>

<p>Like I said, I've been going through that process.</p>

<p>00:10:34:</p>

<p>It has been a challenging one, but a rewarding one as well.</p>

<p>00:10:48:</p>

<p>For those that do that have been following me for a long time.</p>

<p>00:10:51:</p>

<p>They know that Ah usually stream heart stone.</p>

<p>00:10:54:</p>

<p>At night.</p>

<p>00:10:55:</p>

<p>I do another podcast called Bob's Tavern Gas, where I I talk about Harston battle grounds with my friend Don.</p>

<p>00:11:03:</p>

<p>And for the past a month, roughly close to a month now we've been streaming.</p>

<p>00:11:13:</p>

<p>I've been streaming coating instead of harsh stone like almost every day, like we're probably 85 90% like almost every week day.</p>

<p>00:11:31:</p>

<p>I think we've only miss like one or two days, and I was because I wasn't feeling well.</p>

<p>00:11:35:</p>

<p>And then on the weekends, even though I normally say I'm not going Teoh, I wind up streaming anyway, so that's been fun.</p>

<p>00:11:43:</p>

<p>If you want to catch me streaming some some python stuff for some react stuff.</p>

<p>00:11:46:</p>

<p>Whenever I jump into that, you can do so on twitch.</p>

<p>00:11:50:</p>

<p>I want to get well at a link to the show notes, and we'll dive into that.</p>

<p>00:11:55:</p>

<p>But streaming is is just I don't know.</p>

<p>00:11:58:</p>

<p>There's something about writing code and having other people be able to see your code like I don't have large audiences on Twitter, anything like that, and I'm not really trying to chase that or like gain a large audience.</p>

<p>00:12:14:</p>

<p>But at the same time, it's great for when I do have a few people in there and I have run into like a mental block.</p>

<p>00:12:26:</p>

<p>Especially like I said, like I'm recording this late at night.</p>

<p>00:12:29:</p>

<p>Normally I would be streaming, but my computer decided to crash, so we decided to give it a little break.</p>

<p>00:12:37:</p>

<p>But when I hit those walls, it's nice tohave someone in the audience to help out ask questions.</p>

<p>00:12:50:</p>

<p>Usually, some of the audience members aren't very familiar with, like summer familiar with what I'm working on, but they're not familiar with the actual code.</p>

<p>00:12:57:</p>

<p>So they're asking questions, and I'm explaining what I'm doing as I'm doing it, which really helps to drive in the why.</p>

<p>00:13:09:</p>

<p>And of course, I always run into the same errors.</p>

<p>00:13:12:</p>

<p>You know, nothing seems air is the same issues that many other developers run into in your writing code, and you're trying to have your having to explain it.</p>

<p>00:13:21:</p>

<p>Sometimes I write code that doesn't need to be written.</p>

<p>00:13:24:</p>

<p>I find myself doing that more than anything of like writing code that wasn't necessary, Onley to catch myself and then wind of deleting all that later and be like, well, that was dumb and moving on.</p>

<p>00:13:45:</p>

<p>But the idea of consistent streaming is something that I've been playing with.</p>

<p>00:13:49:</p>

<p>It's something that if I were to be a dull developer advocate, that's something that I would possibly be interested in doing.</p>

<p>00:14:00:</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<p>00:14:01:</p>

<p>I'm like, not on behalf of the company, but like being like Oh, hey, by the way, I'm a developer advocate.</p>

<p>00:14:05:</p>

<p>I worked for this company, but I'm also a streamer, and we're gonna stream me learning about this thing and do that mostly to bring a little bit of attention to the coup.</p>

<p>00:14:20:</p>

<p>Whatever company I'm working for, it would be cool to be able to build some of the things that I want to build out in public because it's gonna help me learn about whatever company I'm working with or whatever.</p>

<p>00:14:33:</p>

<p>And then it's also going to be a way for me to connect with more and more people in the community, which is always like the job of an advocate.</p>

<p>00:14:45:</p>

<p>See, Like I said, I've been doing podcast interviews have been streaming.</p>

<p>00:14:47:</p>

<p>I've been, ah, interviewing all these things.</p>

<p>00:14:51:</p>

<p>And then somewhere in there, I've been finding time to work on projects.</p>

<p>00:14:55:</p>

<p>So the first half of the month was basically just render engine.</p>

<p>00:15:00:</p>

<p>I was struggling to get sub collections working.</p>

<p>00:15:03:</p>

<p>What was it was something weirdo.</p>

<p>00:15:05:</p>

<p>I remember what it was.</p>

<p>00:15:07:</p>

<p>At first.</p>

<p>00:15:07:</p>

<p>I was trying to get Paige Nation working.</p>

<p>00:15:09:</p>

<p>I had so collections working.</p>

<p>00:15:10:</p>

<p>And then somehow when I made pagination work, I broke sub collections.</p>

<p>00:15:18:</p>

<p>So then I had to go back and redesign that model.</p>

<p>00:15:22:</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, it works.</p>

<p>00:15:24:</p>

<p>I'm happy everybody's happy, and that's cool.</p>

<p>00:15:29:</p>

<p>Then I turned my focus over to transcript er ah, which is definitely the younger of the products.</p>

<p>00:15:38:</p>

<p>To me, it's the more you know, impactful of the products.</p>

<p>00:15:45:</p>

<p>I have people that are actively wanting to use it.</p>

<p>00:15:47:</p>

<p>So that's kind of what I've been shifting my focus over to it more.</p>

<p>00:15:52:</p>

<p>But in doing that, it's been growing really quickly.</p>

<p>00:16:00:</p>

<p>Um, we have basic functionality already done.</p>

<p>00:16:03:</p>

<p>I'm actually working on extending that functionality to support up loading of, uh, audio files to get them transcribed, which is something that a lot of people who I demoed transcript or too like they all thought, Oh yeah, I just use your program for everything.</p>

<p>00:16:17:</p>

<p>It's like no, actually healing used for the second half on, but I have to go through this like wild process of showing them how you do all that stuff.</p>

<p>00:16:25:</p>

<p>But now I could just be like, Oh, yeah, No, you start.</p>

<p>00:16:27:</p>

<p>You load this as an item, you give it a key, and then you tell it, Teoh, upload, start.</p>

<p>00:16:37:</p>

<p>And then later on, you was pulled the data down.</p>

<p>00:16:43:</p>

<p>So now I got to play with the idea.</p>

<p>00:16:48:</p>

<p>And this is where we're going to get into the news because I think this is kind of important, and it's kind of relevant right now.</p>

<p>00:16:56:</p>

<p>So for those that don't know, productivity in Tech is a podcast, a brand in a business.</p>

<p>00:17:07:</p>

<p>The brand is always kind of loose.</p>

<p>00:17:09:</p>

<p>It's like me helping developers create content and all that stuff.</p>

<p>00:17:13:</p>

<p>Um, the podcast is obviously the podcast, and the brand is kind of my personal brand.</p>

<p>00:17:21:</p>

<p>The K J.</p>

<p>00:17:22:</p>

<p>Miller brand productivity in Tech has stronger brand recognition than K.</p>

<p>00:17:27:</p>

<p>J.</p>

<p>00:17:27:</p>

<p>Miller does honestly, So I don't know why.</p>

<p>00:17:30:</p>

<p>I just don't just own it, but I don't know.</p>

<p>00:17:33:</p>

<p>I kind of like having my name on something, you know, it's kind of nice, but the one of the things that pit the business handles is doing transcriptions Right now.</p>

<p>00:17:51:</p>

<p>I'm working on, um, sealing the deal on a pretty good size project that will have me working or doing a lot of transcriptions in the near future, which is actually why I started working on this as much as I did.</p>

<p>00:18:08:</p>

<p>That project also led me to adding support for transcribing video two transcript her before it was just I worked with your audio.</p>

<p>00:18:22:</p>

<p>I give you a transcript and we call it a deal.</p>

<p>00:18:25:</p>

<p>Now it is.</p>

<p>00:18:28:</p>

<p>Hey, we support sub rib, which is SRT, which is kind of like the subtitles that have been that you see on, like, DVDs and like, YouTube and all that stuff.</p>

<p>00:18:38:</p>

<p>So now transcript or supports that.</p>

<p>00:18:42:</p>

<p>But in working on that, the problem that I always run into is there always seems to be a hiccup when you start talking about developer focused praises as a python developer, you know, we talk about like, Jenga.</p>

<p>00:19:04:</p>

<p>We talk about, um, trying to think of some other Gunn's sequel.</p>

<p>00:19:08:</p>

<p>Alchemy is a good one.</p>

<p>00:19:11:</p>

<p>Ah, post grass is another good one.</p>

<p>00:19:18:</p>

<p>So, and working on that, I generate the transcription first using a machine transcription.</p>

<p>00:19:29:</p>

<p>So like Amazon transcribe is what I use currently I may switch over to azure speech to text because it looks like it's like it's just better.</p>

<p>00:19:40:</p>

<p>I think it's cheaper to, so that's kind of nice We'll have to see.</p>

<p>00:19:47:</p>

<p>But the thing that makes transcription slow is after you get those machine generated transcriptions.</p>

<p>00:20:04:</p>

<p>You didn't have to go through them again by hand and make any corrections, adjust lines.</p>

<p>00:20:11:</p>

<p>All those things that make doing transcriptions more complicated.</p>

<p>00:20:22:</p>

<p>Then one would think.</p>

<p>00:20:25:</p>

<p>In fact, that's why transcriptions are relatively expensive, mine included.</p>

<p>00:20:37:</p>

<p>That's also why a lot of folks don't want to transcribe their content.</p>

<p>00:20:47:</p>

<p>Which brings me to a couple of things.</p>

<p>00:20:51:</p>

<p>One.</p>

<p>00:20:52:</p>

<p>The Future of Transcript Transcript er is first and foremost a wrapper around all of these transcription tools.</p>

<p>00:21:01:</p>

<p>It's designed so that you basically give it whatever service you want.</p>

<p>00:21:06:</p>

<p>You tell to run.</p>

<p>00:21:08:</p>

<p>It runs easy day.</p>

<p>00:21:11:</p>

<p>You don't have to think about which service you want to use, which one's better or whatever, and maybe you do when I think about that.</p>

<p>00:21:19:</p>

<p>But you can kind of switch off using the same methods and names and systems and just go for it.</p>

<p>00:21:31:</p>

<p>But I want to follow up on that with knowledge that will allow me to analyze the work that's being done and come up with rational solutions for common errors in the system and before you message me.</p>

<p>00:22:05:</p>

<p>Yes, I know most of these systems have dictionaries that you can input and load and all these things.</p>

<p>00:22:15:</p>

<p>And maybe in a perfect world, we would build those dictionaries and add them to each one and solve all the problems of the world.</p>

<p>00:22:24:</p>

<p>But here is the problem.</p>

<p>00:22:28:</p>

<p>If I need to load Django phrases if I need to load dot net phrases dotnet terminology into my system, I have the one create that that vocabulary for each of the systems that I'm using.</p>

<p>00:22:51:</p>

<p>Then I have toe upload those vocabularies, and every system is different.</p>

<p>00:22:58:</p>

<p>Some of them have restrictions.</p>

<p>00:22:59:</p>

<p>Some of them don't.</p>

<p>00:23:04:</p>

<p>Then any time it changes.</p>

<p>00:23:07:</p>

<p>Like those vocabulary phrases didn't have to be pulled down, updated, re uploaded, all that good stuff.</p>

<p>00:23:14:</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be easier if I just went with what I got and use the power of quote unquote machine learning to make those changes after the fact?</p>

<p>00:23:28:</p>

<p>And that's what I'm thinking of doing now, and that's a huge project that I would love your support on that Project one.</p>

<p>00:23:36:</p>

<p>It's gonna be open source.</p>

<p>00:23:37:</p>

<p>If you want to contribute code to it, that's great, too.</p>

<p>00:23:40:</p>

<p>I'm gonna need a large data sets reaching out to conference organizers and transcribers once I have this system more robust.</p>

<p>00:23:52:</p>

<p>My goal is to reach out to content creators who are building these transcription libraries, whether it's developer podcasters, whether it's YouTubers, whether it's course creators, whether it's, um, Conference organizer's, there will be a lot of information joining the Web.</p>

<p>00:24:27:</p>

<p>And the gate keepers of the video industry do not seem to want to put forward tools that will help share the load of work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>00:24:51:</p>

<p>YouTube just announced that community contributions will no longer be added to the system.</p>

<p>00:24:58:</p>

<p>I think it's like at the end of the month I think this is a terrible decision, mostly in that many content creators do not have the knowledge to open source their transcriptions in a way that many people can make updates and access them.</p>

<p>00:25:24:</p>

<p>But also many people don't focus on the accessibility impacts of transcriptions, and it will take someone else in the community to help with that that charge so by YouTube saying, we're not gonna let the community contribute to transcriptions or close captions.</p>

<p>00:25:59:</p>

<p>And I know the argument is that not enough people are using the tool.</p>

<p>00:26:04:</p>

<p>I doubted something that you would say is too expensive because you're still gonna offer the exact same.</p>

<p>00:26:11:</p>

<p>The resource is for the content Creator.</p>

<p>00:26:18:</p>

<p>You're not getting rid of transcriptions completely.</p>

<p>00:26:22:</p>

<p>I don't understand why you get rid of this service.</p>

<p>00:26:25:</p>

<p>Maybe you do.</p>

<p>00:26:26:</p>

<p>You don't make it visible on like the front screen.</p>

<p>00:26:29:</p>

<p>Maybe they have to go and like, go to like the more options and, you know, click it in there or something.</p>

<p>00:26:36:</p>

<p>But I don't think it was something that needed to disappear, unless Google is like doing what they usually do, which is constantly shifting the focus of people from one area to another.</p>

<p>00:26:51:</p>

<p>And the easiest way to do that is to remove the area of focus for them.</p>

<p>00:26:55:</p>

<p>Currently, which leads me to my last point.</p>

<p>00:27:08:</p>

<p>Earlier this month, there was these congressional hearings with four of the major companies in the tech space apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p>

<p>00:27:26:</p>

<p>While the conversation of antitrust in some of these conversations I thought were a pervy in Some weren't to me.</p>

<p>00:27:37:</p>

<p>What I and more afraid of now, could be best summed up in a wonderful thought that I saw on Twitter today.</p>

<p>00:27:58:</p>

<p>This came from Chris Hold graph on Twitter.</p>

<p>00:28:02:</p>

<p>You should give him a follows C Hold a graph of the link in the show notes that says, Do you folks think that we're about to enter a new era of centralisation and open source?</p>

<p>00:28:14:</p>

<p>It feels like more more tool chains, framework services and etcetera are controlled by fewer organizations.</p>

<p>00:28:24:</p>

<p>Here's of what scares me.</p>

<p>00:28:28:</p>

<p>Currently, I'm not trying to compete with the biggest names in transcriptions.</p>

<p>00:28:36:</p>

<p>In fact, I'm using their open source tools and requiring that people that use transcript er provide their own credentials for them.</p>

<p>00:28:51:</p>

<p>So if you want to use Transcript er, you have tohave.</p>

<p>00:28:54:</p>

<p>Currently, you have to have an AWS account.</p>

<p>00:28:59:</p>

<p>I'm All I'm doing is making making it easier to use their service.</p>

<p>00:29:05:</p>

<p>But I already see a problem when, in terms of conferences, there are very few choices that people can go with that air affordable and know the lingo of the developer.</p>

<p>00:29:30:</p>

<p>They're very few stenographers that could do real time, close captioning guage.</p>

<p>00:29:34:</p>

<p>It's still amazing to me.</p>

<p>00:29:36:</p>

<p>I wish I wish I knew how to do, um, the Stiner type like stuff that blows my mind.</p>

<p>00:29:45:</p>

<p>I love those conversations with folks, but at the end of the day, we need more companies.</p>

<p>00:30:00:</p>

<p>Right now, there is a huge amount of wealth in Silicon Valley that resides in the hands of less than 100 people.</p>

<p>00:30:20:</p>

<p>That's not to say that there aren't other people out there that are really doing it.</p>

<p>00:30:24:</p>

<p>I saw there was a wonderful block posts about Tailwind, like growing to be like a multi $1,000,000 business and stuff like that, which I think is amazing.</p>

<p>00:30:33:</p>

<p>Um, I have my questions about why it, Selwyn, because I'm just not a fan of the u I.</p>

<p>00:30:39:</p>

<p>But that's me that doesn't take away from the stuff that they're doing.</p>

<p>00:30:47:</p>

<p>There have been so many conversations on this podcast on other shows about the idea of fixing the the wealth disparity in America, and I think a big part of that is reducing the amount of oneness in American technology.</p>

<p>00:31:18:</p>

<p>Every company that is doing something great is one acquisition away from it being a feature, a feature that could be removed.</p>

<p>00:31:32:</p>

<p>It will a feature that can be regulated and locked down and a feature that can be monetized to the extreme.</p>

<p>00:31:41:</p>

<p>And I'm not saying that this happens with every single feature, But we've seen it time and time again, where a great idea gets swallowed by a larger company for the patents, for the licensing and for the economy.</p>

<p>00:32:00:</p>

<p>And in doing that, we're now stifling the ability to distribute wealth amongst the many and instead that wealth remains in the hands of the few.</p>

<p>00:32:21:</p>

<p>Now I'm not here to solve the economy problems, but what I can do is follow the mission statement That is, productivity in tech.</p>

<p>00:32:37:</p>

<p>And that is we are a company that helps people in tech create content for people in tech and anything that would cause us to skill.</p>

<p>00:32:55:</p>

<p>Beyond that focus is something that I'm not quite interested in, and it's something that I would question if there others out there that want to help achieve that goal.</p>

<p>00:33:17:</p>

<p>I don't believe that it has to be everybody's mission.</p>

<p>00:33:20:</p>

<p>I think that there's a good a good opportunity for people to help people that aren't in the tech space there some wonderful knishes that can be helped.</p>

<p>00:33:30:</p>

<p>In fact, many of the tools that I make could be used outside of the tech space.</p>

<p>00:33:35:</p>

<p>It just so happens that I build them with the developer first.</p>

<p>00:33:40:</p>

<p>So a lot of the decisions that I'm making are based on that.</p>

<p>00:33:49:</p>

<p>So I'm gonna wrap it up there with this episode.</p>

<p>00:33:55:</p>

<p>If you want to connect with me, you can do so.</p>

<p>00:33:57:</p>

<p>Cagey miller dot com Of course, you can follow the podcast podcast.</p>

<p>00:34:00:</p>

<p>Stop productivity in tech dot com.</p>

<p>00:34:03:</p>

<p>Productivity intact is all one word.</p>

<p>00:34:06:</p>

<p>And of course, if you like render engine transcript or any of the developer works that I'm doing, you can support my work on Get Hub using to get have sponsors link in the show notes.</p>

<p>00:34:20:</p>

<p>Now, Thank you so much for listening.</p>

<p>00:34:24:</p>

<p>I hope that we've been productive.</p>

<p>00:34:26:</p>

<p>I hope that we've inspired you to think a little bit about what you're doing currently, and I hope that you will challenge the thoughts of the majority of the power being in the hands of the few when it comes to the economy.</p>

<p>00:34:48:</p>

<p>When it comes to ownership of Open source.</p>

<p>00:34:52:</p>

<p>And ultimately, when it comes to your productivity, I would challenge you to do something that's just for you.</p>

<p>00:35:06:</p>

<p>Do something that's gonna, I hope, solve your goal.</p>

<p>00:35:11:</p>

<p>Don't do it for the money.</p>

<p>00:35:14:</p>

<p>Don't do it for the accolades.</p>

<p>00:35:16:</p>

<p>Do it because you want to learn.</p>

<p>00:35:19:</p>

<p>Do it publicly.</p>

<p>00:35:21:</p>

<p>Make mistakes is miss.</p>

<p>00:35:23:</p>

<p>Result would say, Take chances, get messy.</p>

<p>00:35:28:</p>

<p>But ultimately, that's the ticket to being more productive.</p>

<p>00:35:32:</p>

<p>I'm Jay Millar.</p>

<p>00:35:33:</p>

<p>This spin productivity in tech reflections Have a good day.</p>

<p>I was happy to meet fellow BuJo User <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurabroder/?hl=en">Laura Broder</a>. We seem like two folks cut from a very similar cloth. </p>

<p>I'm seeing more people investing in hybridism and the overall feeling that analog bullet journaling doesn't seem to fit in many folks digital workflow.</p>

<p>In my tribe I feel like a loner as most folks feel they need new tricks and tools to make bullet journaling work. That said I feel like there is still a (decreasing) audience for folks that need to keep their life and productivity contained in a notebook.</p>

<title>Announcing Transcriptor</title>  <description><![CDATA[<h2>This was the launch month for [Transcriptor]. This is a helper package that I use for doing transcriptions for PIT Clients.</h2>

<p>Transcriptions can be accomplished in a plethora of ways, but in order to do it, you need to have a good idea of how to work with the results from your transcription engine.

<p>Jay 00:00:17:</p>

<p>lots of everybody. J. Miller here back with another productivity in tech podcast. I hope you're having a fantastic week and mine just got a little bit better because I have the wonder and privilege to talk to someone that I have known for</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:36:</p>

<p>God like six years now And one of the first people I met when I became a programmer Ah always brings a smile to my face to see them Talks are absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And also just a generally overall just glowing person. Not because the radioactive, but because they just know how to brighten up a room. I am talking with the one the only Melanie crutch build. Melanie is so good to see you.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:09:</p>

<p>Wow, I The glowing, I think is like I think this is just fire of, like, embarrassment on my face now because you know</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:19:</p>

<p>the first of a nice say, like San Diego wildfires like G, it's like, well, not really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:24:</p>

<p>know Now I think it</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:26:</p>

<p>started. I guess so,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're we're hanging in there so far like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:33:</p>

<p>it's funny. It didn't quite into my consciousness that we have like yet another plague that we could layer onto 2020 like he's, you know, like of the seven layer salad of For that, 2020 is becoming like fires. I almost forgot, J thank you.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:54:</p>

<p>Under, I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:55:</p>

<p>guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:57:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:01:58:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bless it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jay 00:02:00:</p>

<p>Yes. So other than the obvious, um, perils that air plaguing America right now. How have you been? Generally?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:12:</p>

<p>Uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:13:</p>

<p>yeah. Well,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:16:</p>

<p>um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:18:</p>

<p>okay, so my my measurements of how I'm doing might be slightly different than the average person. Like if I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:30:</p>

<p>and awake</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:32:</p>

<p>and I have clothes on my body Bonus bonus. Both of those air working today, I have fed my cells.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:41:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:44:</p>

<p>yeah, and I got a couple of things done today. I mean, that's like, I'm like, living my best life</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:50:</p>

<p>at that point.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:54:</p>

<p>because, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:02:56:</p>

<p>it is, uh, often that those are not my days. You know, um, that they don't quite look like that because of, um because I have major depressive disorder. Um, I also have, like a really fun and exciting relationship with migraines, So there's that I have the anxiety. I have epilepsy, which is is fun,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:23:</p>

<p>that it's well controlled, so it's not as it's not as interesting or imitating as it might be. otherwise so, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:31:</p>

<p>but the, you know, the depression really gives you a completely different, um, scale of success,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:03:38:</p>

<p>I guess. Is what what I might call it. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:43:</p>

<p>as someone who often has to tell people in social environments of like, hey, if I start laughing really hard, can you just make sure I don't collapse? Um, I can relate. Um, that has the last few years ever since, you know, cardiac episode after cardiac episode,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:02:</p>

<p>you do start to take a lot of things that other people I guess we take for granted. You, like, treat them as this has been a good day. I haven't blacked out in five days like OK, that is that is like an awesome feeling. All</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:17:</p>

<p>right.</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:17:</p>

<p>So I can I can totally relate</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:21:</p>

<p>to where you're coming from their Well,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:24:</p>

<p>do me a favor, because I know you well, but the people listening to the show probably don't know you as well as ideo. So kind of Introduce yourself. Let people know who you are, what you do and, uh, ultimately like, what brings you joy in the tech space?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:42:</p>

<p>Oh, good gracious. OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:43:</p>

<p>just some smiles, you know?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:45:</p>

<p>Yeah, Just anybody stuff? Um, let's see. I am a python and jingle developer.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:04:53:</p>

<p>Um, I am self taught. I went to two years of college and then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:01:</p>

<p>didn't go to college after that. Which they still turned you for. Interestingly love? Um, yeah. Uh, wow. Yeah. And spread this whole different thing. But private school is a racket. I don't know why you do that. Um, yes. So I did that I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:20:</p>

<p>and then much later in life, I got into development because it is fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:26:</p>

<p>Um, I started out like my professional life was in fine art photographic printing. So I had about a decade of, ah, life in the art world there, which makes it sound much sexier than it was. Um, although it was fun and good, like, that was a good time. And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:46:</p>

<p>I had my first daughter and kind of rejected out of the job, seen for a while. And when I came back,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:54:</p>

<p>I wanted to do something that, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:05:57:</p>

<p>compensated for my time in a in a decent way, you know, especially living in San Diego. Um, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:07:</p>

<p>I just thought, you know, I had done I have done some little like apple script scripts. Do you know what this thing is? What? Apples with this? Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:17:</p>

<p>you</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:17:</p>

<p>get a few of them. Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:20:</p>

<p>usually ones that turn my mic off because I am notorious for, like, ending a conversation being done and then later on, just being like, Oh, the recording still going And then like having three hours of just dead audio toe toe work on?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:36:</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, it's just a little fiddly stuff like that. And so I am. I made some scripts, like, way back</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:45:</p>

<p>many, many years ago. I don't know, 15 years ago or something, And, uh</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:50:</p>

<p>so when I was trying to figure out where am I gonna go now with my career and loves, like, you know, I had fun with that. I'm one,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:06:59:</p>

<p>you know, making computers do stuff. Like maybe I could do some of that same born, um, and then came, you know, in my learning process came across the python community in San Diego and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:11:</p>

<p>that was it. That's how I am. Kind of got my heat settled.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:17:</p>

<p>So, um, I work in a rightly or really not the car shop, as we were discussing earlier. Um, although I have repaired my car in a variety of ways on my own.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:29:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:31:</p>

<p>it still works. It still runs Most of the things we're still on there. It does have a weird rattle. Um, anyway, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:39:</p>

<p>and my little side projects five up is still</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:44:</p>

<p>up and running.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:46:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:48:</p>

<p>that's me. I have two kids. I'm cat</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:51:</p>

<p>E, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:07:53:</p>

<p>But I think that's it. The end. Is there more? What else should I say?</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:58:</p>

<p>No, that's it. That's good podcast. No, no, we're gonna look, look, goingto a lot of more detail than that, but but yeah, let's let's start with you know, one of the things that you just brought up was</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:11:</p>

<p>you wanted to do a job that you felt you were being compensated for. I guess I would say as fairly as</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:22:</p>

<p>weird systems that can</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:25:</p>

<p>Yeah, we're not gonna go into that conversation. That's another podcast. But, ah, the big thing was, it wasn't, You know, development wasn't something that you were like.</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:36:</p>

<p>Hey, I'm, like, 14 and hacking in tow. You know, the U S treasury and I've always been a programmer, and like, it wasn't like this whole crazy lifestyle thing for Yeah, I was like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:50:</p>

<p>Here's a small piece of my life that I do that</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:54:</p>

<p>I mean, it be cool if I got paid to do this. I mean, like that. That's a really</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:59:</p>

<p>interesting approach, because it kind of goes against what everybody is taught. You know, when you go to high school, you have to do like, Oh, yeah, you know, you need to go to the best school toe, get into engineering or get into our did to get into all these things. And it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:16:</p>

<p>or you could just live your life, do the things that you enjoy doing and then find something in that realm that actually gives you a paycheck and then do that and then in your free time, make really cool stuff like five up, which we're gonna talk about later. Um, so So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool. Did you find a challenge? Ah, like, did you find it challenging to get into the tech space, Not having the I went toe Caltech or m I t. And you know up. You know, I was born with a keyboard in my hand, like that whole mindset.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:52:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:09:55:</p>

<p>it's tricky because I feel like not having those types of credentials.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:06:</p>

<p>I still like it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:08:</p>

<p>It affects me like it means more to me than it does to other people. You know, I'm</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:16:</p>

<p>I'm grateful. I mean, that's from my experience. Like, I'm grateful that I hade, um, the experience of applying to Riley in working through that process and not</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:31:</p>

<p>not having the pressure to have some sort of pedigree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:36:</p>

<p>in intact.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:39:</p>

<p>So I didn't experience that, But it is always really interesting to talk, Teoh. Other folks that do you have an experience? I was talking to someone the other day who was mentioning that, um, it just so happened that in there, like a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:10:59:</p>

<p>computer science class that they had,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:03:</p>

<p>they're like senior year in high school, which, first of all, ending a farming town.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:09:</p>

<p>We had f A like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:12:</p>

<p>also way.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:14:</p>

<p>The way that my life shook out. I only I graduated early, surly had, like, one semester of my senior year. And then I went and, like, works in a coffee shop after that, you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:25:</p>

<p>our situations were like small time, different So but he,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:30:</p>

<p>you know, was saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:33:</p>

<p>in my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:34:</p>

<p>in my a p</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:36:</p>

<p>CS class.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:11:39:</p>

<p>The teacher happens to know, like the super good friends that someone high up in, you know, X y z tech, like in a huge tech company. And so this BP or whatever from this big tech company comes in and does like, practice interviews with every limits in the class. They're seniors, the high school, they're like 17. You know what I'm saying? Like were 18 or however old they are. They're teenagers, though, for sure. So there's these</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:07:</p>

<p>teenagers. Some of them then got jobs like straight out of high school.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:13:</p>

<p>It's like I was just kind of like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:17:</p>

<p>whoa,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:19:</p>

<p>you know, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:20:</p>

<p>and I know that, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:24:</p>

<p>you know, you were saying</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:26:</p>

<p>a second ago like we don't want to get into the whole, like, inequality and what's like, you know, fair compensation and stuff.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:33:</p>

<p>Um, but it is just kind of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:36:</p>

<p>it is kind of mind blowing, right that some people do walk into the tech space saying, you know, I have</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:44:</p>

<p>I have all these credentials. I have all these this experiments, you know, and I'm like one of the computer stuff, but which I did.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:12:55:</p>

<p>I did have a continuing everyone Yeah, yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:13:01:</p>

<p>I've played Tetris super good at it</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:05:</p>

<p>for me. I always hesitate, you know, toe to talk about kind of the entrance into the tech space, Um, from any level of knowledge, because I technically haven't entered the development space working on it trying really am. But, you know, it is interesting to hear, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:27:</p>

<p>the conversation of</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:30:</p>

<p>you have a perfect example</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:33:</p>

<p>giving a resume to someone or like this, presenting a resume to a company and, like having two people</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:40:</p>

<p>look at your resume and tell you to conflicting things like one is like, Oh, you need to focus on your projects more because you don't have the job experience and one says, Oh, but your other job experience is super relatable for a higher management position, so you should focus on that more, and it's like, Okay, I have one person telling me to put my job experience at the front. The other one told me to put my projects at the front. I can't put them both there like I need writing something. So it it's always interesting to hear the idea of like</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:11:</p>

<p>it can't be this hard</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:13:</p>

<p>for everybody, and it's not necessarily.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:18:</p>

<p>You know, I don't have a solution for that, but I would just I love hearing people address that, like OK, yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:26:</p>

<p>For some people, it was extremely easy for others. It was a little bit harder. And then for some, they're still trying to get their foot in the door. Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:36:</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, I'm glad for some of the people who have</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:41:</p>

<p>gone through whatever they did,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:44:</p>

<p>because now they know what it took, which means they're willing to help other people not have to go through that same thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:52:</p>

<p>Yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:14:53:</p>

<p>And I have to say, like, you know, I worked hard. I tried to learn, I went to conferences and, you know, I built my thing, and I did</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:04:</p>

<p>Those couple of talks like, I put time and energy into it,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:11:</p>

<p>but I knew someone. I honestly think that networking is huge,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:19:</p>

<p>which is also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:23:</p>

<p>just a huge, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:27:</p>

<p>playground for injustice</p>

<p>Melanie 00:15:30:</p>

<p>right</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:30:</p>

<p>now</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:32:</p>

<p>because not everybody knows. Well, it I guess the hard part is, is like, if you know someone, you could get a foot in the door. But like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:41:</p>

<p>the people that don't know anyone have a problem And then there's also like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:46:</p>

<p>the We don't want to punish you for bringing in the wrong people kind of feeling that they come that comes with it. Like I I see so many people of color that air in</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:58:</p>

<p>management levels that work with no other people of color. And it's just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:05:</p>

<p>I mean, I'm glad you're not like using it as a way to, like, bring just anybody in. But at the same time, it seems really weird that, like there's not one and it and it's because of that. It's like, Well, if I</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:20:</p>

<p>What if I make a mistake? What if I I have a bad higher and they happen to be a person of color? And then now you're making the problem even worse and even harder for other people in it. It's like again,</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:33:</p>

<p>I just wish that it wasn't this hard for everyone and that they didn't have to go to sleep, you know, worrying about their job because they hired someone that they know is capable of doing the work. But because of how they look, you know, it could be a problem. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:16:46:</p>

<p>ultimately, I don't think that the conversation we're gonna have here is probably gonna solve that problem. But I do hope that someone listening, uh, maybe you can, you know, solve a smaller problem like that and you know your own little world.</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:02:</p>

<p>But you talked about</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:05:</p>

<p>you know, you</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:06:</p>

<p>all the things that you did Do you know, aside from knowing someone like you gave the talks, you built the thing. Like when I first met you,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:17:</p>

<p>I was trying to build a thing</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:19:</p>

<p>and, like, I had no clue what I was doing. And I think, um, a good like, a couple of mutual friends of ours were just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:27:</p>

<p>I mean, this is a cool idea. What are you doing</p>

<p>Melanie 00:17:31:</p>

<p>on? I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:33:</p>

<p>I I had probably I'd probably been using Python for maybe, like, a week and 1/2. So it was like, I have an exact problem. I've solved it in kind of this really ugly way. Now I want to take it to the next step and solve it in a slightly less ugly way. And in doing that, I just kind of screwed it up. But I'm going to talk about your</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:56:</p>

<p>Django app that just brings joy into the world and phones of people. So I'm just gonna I'm going to just sit back and let you just talk about about the app. Talk about the idea for it. Talk about you know what it's been like running it for as long as you've been running. I can't I can't imagine. Like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:16:</p>

<p>I don't think I have anything that's been in the wild for, like, more than a year.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:22:</p>

<p>Yeah. Um, so</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:25:</p>

<p>five opap dot com</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:27:</p>

<p>It's a Django out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:29:</p>

<p>Um, it is not a phone app. I have to say the whole I was just thinking about this today. I think five up dot com was taken. And so I think that's where I went with five. Look after Tom. But to non tech people, like they're like, what's the thing that I download in the night? Just have to say, I'm sorry I made a thing that's confusing. Just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:51:</p>

<p>just ignore that for a second and felt the form and give me all of your personal contact information.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:18:57:</p>

<p>And then something good is gonna happen. Trust possibly did. Yeah. I mean, I'm a random person on the Internet. Why not? You know. So, um, yes. So what it does is it sends happy texts every day. That's its only function. That's all it does. I got the idea. It's build it because I actually, um the first, like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:23:</p>

<p>class that I took on python was through Udacity. And they have this bit in there Where you, um you had to make a little bit of a project using Tulio.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:39:</p>

<p>Um and so I had done, like, I had kind of come up with this idea of, like, isn't that when that be nice to just get happened? Texts</p>

<p>Melanie 00:19:48:</p>

<p>And part of the idea between our for sending five texts, which is what it was initially that you could only get five, and that was it. Like you're gonna have a quantity of five. Happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:01:</p>

<p>We're guard lis of what you like. That's what you're getting. Um, but the idea is there's some research that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:11:</p>

<p>maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Whatever. Um, but this concept that need 3 to 5 positive things to outweigh each negatives thing that happens to you. So the idea is like, I'm kind of betting on a negative thing, but you every day. But I mean, if you end up with a surplus of happy. It's fine. It's time</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:36:</p>

<p>not to be upset about it. So eventually I changed it so that you can choose</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:42:</p>

<p>1234 or five per day</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:46:</p>

<p>because people were like, it's too happy</p>

<p>Melanie 00:20:48:</p>

<p>saying they were actually just like is like a really, really happy person around you and your like, you're just annoying. Now. I'm sorry. Like I love the people are friendly and something is working well for you, but if you could do it away from me, that would be wonderful. So, um, video just a little bit of happened. Just one.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:08:</p>

<p>yeah, and</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:11:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:12:</p>

<p>So I came to the Python meet up with this, you know, kind of baby idea, this python script, Um, and then someone was like, oh, built the Django</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:22:</p>

<p>and I was like, all right, you know, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:26:</p>

<p>and then it was just like months of being like I don't know what I'm doing at all and just going home and, like, suffering through, you know, trying to go through this development process and figure it was going on like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:21:43:</p>

<p>I didn't know it at the time, and I do now. It's kind of both comforting and in infuriating that like hours, hours, and hours, days, weeks of developers time are spent over, like a semi colon in the wrong place. You know, like just a single character, you know, or just this, these the tiniest thing. So, you know, I went two months of that and then eventually got it somewhat working. It was very buggy at first. Um, it is still kind of bugging. Actually Had someone report above a couple weeks ago, and I I almost have it. Thanks, but, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:27:</p>

<p>you know, life, but whatever.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:30:</p>

<p>We need bugs in life, I guess.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:33:</p>

<p>Yeah. I mean...No.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:36:</p>

<p>no, I got in your gardens</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:40:</p>

<p>right there. Get in the garden. I always try to do that. Things I have young kids, you know where you're like. Let me spine</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:46:</p>

<p>finds him to be grateful for about that, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:51:</p>

<p>bugs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:22:52:</p>

<p>reminds us that we're fallible or something. I</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:57:</p>

<p>Oh, that's that's too funny, though. And I love that, like, again. A lot of the story that came from from this was</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:08:</p>

<p>a level of like, I understand that that life sucks at times.</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:13:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:15:</p>

<p>at best I'm I'm leveling the playing field or I guess it. At worst, I'm leveling the playing field That best I'm giving you, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:24:</p>

<p>extra happy. Which to me, that is That is like</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:30:</p>

<p>a lot of people know, like my favorite</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:33:</p>

<p>personality in the entire world is the late, great Bob Ross, and it was just like nobody on the planet should ever be. This happy like the guy, like adopt squirrels. It's,</p>

<p>Jay 00:23:48:</p>

<p>I think, of the some of the greatest people that have ever lived. Like Nikola Tesla apparently married a pigeon like there's just a level of coziness that just comes with being</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:01:</p>

<p>an amazing person. And I think that if you could be crazily like happy and just want other people to be justice crazily happy as you like that is the best possible outcome because the</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:18:</p>

<p>the worst</p>

<p>Melanie 00:24:18:</p>

<p>side of that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:19:</p>

<p>like serial killer. So it's like extremely happy sociopath. Serial killer. Where on the spectrum are you and right? So I love that one that you're using your coding skills for good and not sociopathic serial killer. He stuff,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, but also that</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:39:</p>

<p>you pushed through because it was just suggested to you. Um, I am like the exact opposite of that someone tells me to build a jangle after like that. I don't want to build a jingle app. I want to build a flask app. I want a village static site generator like I want to do everything but the thing that everyone is telling me to do because they're telling me to do it this way. And I need to know why I shouldn't do it that 8000 other ways.</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:03:</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:05:</p>

<p>on top of that, you were actually willing to</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:09:</p>

<p>share that experience with the community and not just the app itself. But I've I've had the privilege of listening to what I would consider the greatest python conference talk ever. Um, which is like, so you want to build a jingle app? It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:25:</p>

<p>you. You bring your personality into</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:30:</p>

<p>all the things that you do like. I'm on the 50 website and it's like how it works. Sometimes life has sad things. We have happy messages,</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:38:</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:25:38:</p>

<p>you're not</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:39:</p>

<p>so sad anymore. And it's just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:42:</p>

<p>it doesn't have this weird like s CEO, like marketing spend using 15 different buzzwords for social ranking and like all of this other stuff that people try to do to game the system. It's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:57:</p>

<p>it is</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:58:</p>

<p>truly a Melanie Appetite, Melanie website and time. I would be afraid to look at the code because I'm sure the comments would just have me laughing. It's like, This is stupid. I'm not gonna dio because that's what my code looks like. It's like, I hate that I have to</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:15:</p>

<p>do this</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:16:</p>

<p>But apparently Python hates me. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:20:</p>

<p>usually those air like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:22:</p>

<p>I bet my get history</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:24:</p>

<p>my get history is where I hide my secret feelings for sure. Like less often. Yeah, exactly less often in the code itself, I think.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:35:</p>

<p>But Gathers I think there's some some fun. Makes sense Is that there Are you looking girl, your eyes</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:45:</p>

<p>looking for a good one? Execute some lint ing c L. I love it. It's just like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:26:50:</p>

<p>Oh, see, that's recent. Yeah, that's me. Just do you want stuff cleaning up?</p>

<p>Jay 00:26:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, that's I probably should do deleted, weird static directory. Stuff like this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:27:03:</p>

<p>is I go. This is</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:04:</p>

<p>the stuff that I think developers need to see on a more regular basis because you get these weird posts or, like, how to write ineffective, get commit messages like I mean, yes, sure, I understand. If someone's reviewing your code, you want to make it as helpful when is clear and concise as possible, but at the same time being able to just get your frustration out a little bit and I get commit?</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:28:</p>

<p>Sure, do it. I think that's absolutely a wonderful way. Teoh, Uh, one not go insane, but to also again inject a little bit of yourself into your work. And, uh, I mean, you've always done that, But please tell everybody about some of the talks you've given about this about well, about the five up app. And also</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:53:</p>

<p>just why just just why? Because the, um I can't even I can't even begin Teoh like breakdown like the talks themselves because they're so good.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:07:</p>

<p>Ah, they really I mean, that's</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:09:</p>

<p>that's not me. Like, you know, trying to butter you up. I genuinely you made me try Django for the first time, literally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:16:</p>

<p>You're talking</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:17:</p>

<p>like OK, I will use Django, but only because Melanie said it's not as bad as it looks.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:24:</p>

<p>It's not as bad as it looks. Um, yeah, So I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:31:</p>

<p>I think I only have the two talks that I ever</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:35:</p>

<p>like, actually gays. I gave them both multiple times, though, um, And then I did also do a, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:44:</p>

<p>like an injured a python that life on a couple years in a row. Um, that waas, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:51:</p>

<p>in short, a python for human people with feelings.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:28:55:</p>

<p>Um, which was a lot of fun, I think. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:00:</p>

<p>getting in and out on a 25 minute talk is way more manageable for me. Like I think that that's kind of my sweet spot. Three hours of like, having to make sense is pretty tricky.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:13:</p>

<p>Just like I'm so sorry. Everyone, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:29:16:</p>

<p>three hours long,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:18:</p>

<p>red, like in the end, you're just like, I don't know, let's talk about those bugs again or something. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:27:</p>

<p>so, yeah, the first talk that I wrote waas about my experience writing five up and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:34:</p>

<p>all of the things that I did long because some of them were kind of like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:39:</p>

<p>a little bit tragic, you know, like I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:43:</p>

<p>like, recoverable, like I figured it out. But like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:46:</p>

<p>you know, my email and password were like, committed. And to get at some point</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:52:</p>

<p>like that, I agree</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:54:</p>

<p>that it's not the best.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:29:56:</p>

<p>Um And then just like accidentally destroying stuff, it's all these stuff. I mean, I don't know that everyone, like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:30:04:</p>

<p>puts their email and password in their code. Like I feel like I kind of win on that one for, like, dumb stuff that you do on accident. Like I'm pretty</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:15:</p>

<p>sure people have done Aziz Muchas They would admit they'd be like, No, I've never done that. I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:21:</p>

<p>Miguel Road, like McGill did a talk about that. I think it pike on a couple of years ago. That's like you accidentally committed your password. Now what do you dio? And to me, that was great because it was saying like, OK,</p>

<p>Jay 00:30:35:</p>

<p>probably one of the most like prominent people to use the plastic framework is telling me that he has screwed up by putting, you know, some type of environment variable that shouldn't be in there or some type of password or some type of authentic r A p I key. That should not have been hard coded in there like he has done this. So when I mean after that talk, I was like, OK, I am team environment, variable for life like</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:02:</p>

<p>the first thing you see is like import os every time because I'm like I will not do that again. I've had that happen to me where someone's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:31:11:</p>

<p>Yeah, heads up, You should Ah, like I submitted a PR that removed your password for you and I'm like, Oh, thank you for that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:19:</p>

<p>Cool, Great. That's hopeful.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:23:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. So And I think</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:28:</p>

<p>I don't know. I think it's important for people to know like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:32:</p>

<p>there's there's no magic going on here. I mean, people do harder stuff than what Ideo like. I understand that, um, and that people are hearing like super fans and stuff. Andi. But</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:47:</p>

<p>like I'm fancy enough to be employed. So that's something you know and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:31:53:</p>

<p>and it's not amazing it I mean, like, it's not. It's not so magical and difficult that you can't do it. You know that you can't like you can become a developer and also be a little bit of a bumbling weirdo like these things can be for you. You could be that in one thing. So like, and I I I feel like our fear of</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:19:</p>

<p>wow</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:20:</p>

<p>making mistakes</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:22:</p>

<p>and like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:24:</p>

<p>being stealing hard,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:26:</p>

<p>keeps us out of spaces where we could really fries. You know, um, and I always imagine that there's someone in the room that is sitting there being like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:37:</p>

<p>Well, I could never you know, because that's me, like, 48</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:43:</p>

<p>100% of the time I was gonna go 48%. But that's a lie. And 4800. It's not really a value that makes any sense, since, though,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:32:52:</p>

<p>and I have a job, everybody</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:54:</p>

<p>and and the thing with that, like</p>

<p>Jay 00:32:59:</p>

<p>I I grew up around</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:01:</p>

<p>like the biggest nerd in the world like my grandfather wanted me to be into computers like he let me take apart his computer. He made me put it back together. Um, like I grew up playing with the max, which is probably why I don't use the Mac's in Al.</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:19:</p>

<p>Like I thought one of the first computer games was Eclipse, which is ah, like a job I d</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:28:</p>

<p>on. He was</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:29:</p>

<p>just like, yeah, I just draw stuff in the things and I was like, OK, cool. I'm gonna make a computer game and, like No, no, I didn't. But he knew that I wasn't going to, but he was like Yeah, sure. Try it anyway. And like, this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:33:40:</p>

<p>is the kind of</p>

<p>Jay 00:33:41:</p>

<p>guy that he went to the university library to doubt, like rent out algebra books for fun. And I'm just like your old man. You're supposed to be, like, watching like, daytime news and sleeping on the couch or something. And I always thought that that's what it meant to be like in the tech space of lying. So you gotta get a like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:06:</p>

<p>if you haven't read every Manning book that's out there, you have it. If you don't have, like, the subscription toe like O'Reilly learning, then you're doing it wrong. You need toe. You need to, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:17:</p>

<p>have submitted, like at least three talks toe every major conference using your language. You need to have been to every talk. Like I hear about all the people that love and fawn over WWDC, and they're like, Oh, it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:33:</p>

<p>the mecca for IOS developers is like, Oh, it's like the mecca for conference viruses. So you probably shouldn't like</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:42:</p>

<p>put that stigma on people. Not everyone wants to go to a conference. Everyone is can understand half of what you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:34:52:</p>

<p>someone who has a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering and has turned that into, like writing functional algorithms using Haskell like not everyone can do.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:05:</p>

<p>Not everyone can understand that. And if</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:07:</p>

<p>you don't, it's okay. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:09:</p>

<p>I think</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:10:</p>

<p>Python, because it's readable, literally showed</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:13:</p>

<p>100 lines of python code that I had written Teoh, a graphic designer, and they were like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:19:</p>

<p>I think you miss. I think there's a space after this comma that's not supposed to be there. And I was like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:24:</p>

<p>How are you debugging my</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:29:</p>

<p>like that to</p>

<p>Jay 00:35:30:</p>

<p>me is amazing that people can look at the code, read it and understand what's happening, and that it eliminates the stigma of like you have to have void and no parameters instead of code and and it immediately closes the door on people who are just like, Yeah, I just wanna send five happy tweets. You know, our five happy text to my phone like, Can I do that?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:53:</p>

<p>No. One?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:35:55:</p>

<p>No, I I love Python. For that reason, I do think like it's one of the more low entry languages out there.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:05:</p>

<p>I've been working with Java script a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and I want to love all languages equally.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:19:</p>

<p>I want that so bad.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:21:</p>

<p>Also Pythons the best. I don't know. I don't. I'm sorry, everyone. I just</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:28:</p>

<p>It's just clean ends.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:32:</p>

<p>I don't know. It's it's low entry. I think, Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:37:</p>

<p>yeah, it's good stuff, but what you were saying, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:42:</p>

<p>a second ago about</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:44:</p>

<p>this huge range of like one</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:48:</p>

<p>you know, one engineer has a PhD in is doing this grace and stuff, you know, down to like, here's me,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:36:56:</p>

<p>you know, making my little Web app. That doesn't silly and nice thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:01:</p>

<p>Um, that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:03:</p>

<p>that gap</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:06:</p>

<p>was really difficult and overwhelming to experience at my first pie con, Um, because it's, you know what, like 3500 people or something. And you do have these people that have their doctorates and, you know, like listening to some of the talks. I remember because I was, you know, obviously much newer to Python at the time. Um, but I remember just being like I'm not doing,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:35:</p>

<p>you know, like we'd go into a room and there's like, Here's a 20 minute talk</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:40:</p>

<p>and, like I know they said words and there were slides like there were visuals, so a lot of stuff happening there. And yet</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:48:</p>

<p>I have no idea what just happened.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:52:</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:54:</p>

<p>no, you know, And then</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:57:</p>

<p>the,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:37:58:</p>

<p>you know, kind of the little circles of people that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:02:</p>

<p>then joined up in our like, you know, what do you dio And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:06:</p>

<p>you know, like, I do fancy things, You know? I'm like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:11:</p>

<p>Hyson tweets the tell you your sparkling mermaid, not tweets and text messages, You know, actual message by the way you mentioned earlier. Bob Ross. Do you know that? I quote Bob Breast in private.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:24:</p>

<p>I didn't. And now</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:27:</p>

<p>I I don't get text messages. City</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:31:</p>

<p>I probably drug simple.</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:32:</p>

<p>No, it's not you. It's I go, Yeah, I did this thing where it was like, don't ever get a message or like, a phone call from anyone that's on your favorites. And ever since then, people like chaos and your message lychee After you did</p>

<p>Jay 00:38:49:</p>

<p>e don't get half my messages anymore, which is great, cause I have plausible deniability. Anytime I don't want to do something like I didn't get the message. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's awesome.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:38:59:</p>

<p>I mean, you broke up with me, and I just found out</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:03:</p>

<p>and we literally had a like It's not years me moments that happened</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:10:</p>

<p>that's gonna be on the Internet now is fine. Oh, man.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:14:</p>

<p>Science. My received text that I send myself. That's what I going to dio like self wish that I do. Now</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:23:</p>

<p>I'm gonna do the horrible thing you should never do after a breakup. I'm just gonna keep going forward.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:28:</p>

<p>Thank</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:32:</p>

<p>you. Talked about, like, just kind of the vast difference of conversations that air had it conferences.</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:42:</p>

<p>I gave my first conference talk at North Bay Python last year and, uh,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:39:50:</p>

<p>I couldn't go. So a conference, it</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:53:</p>

<p>really isn't there not having won this year, which I mean,</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:57:</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>Jay 00:39:58:</p>

<p>they announced it last year that they were having won. I felt like I felt like they</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:02:</p>

<p>feel like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:02:</p>

<p>Josh knew he was just like, something's gonna happen. He's like, we don't want to be a part of it. We're out this year will see on two years. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:12:</p>

<p>one of the talks, that was it was like the second I was the last talk in the first half. And then the next talk after me was Greedo. And he was talking about writing. He was</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:25:</p>

<p>talking about writing</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:25:</p>

<p>a peg par surfer python. And I'm just like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:40:29:</p>

<p>I don't know what</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:30:</p>

<p>you're talking about. I'm gonna look, and I'm just gonna be like, Okay, Yeah, sure, whatever. And then we all got dinner together and it was me,</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:41:</p>

<p>you know, And then, like a couple of other developers that are like python core maintainers and I'm just like</p>

<p>Jay 00:40:48:</p>

<p>and luckily, my talk was mostly about podcasting, So I felt like I knew what I was talking about, but they were all like, Ah, yes. So I would really love to learn how like podcasting could be implemented, you know, in a larger</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:04:</p>

<p>audience in the python community. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I would love to learn more about whatever it is you talked about earlier to Andi. That's like, That's the crazy feeling that when we create this facade that, like, you have to have a PhD, you have to be, you know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:23:</p>

<p>a huge brainiac to write code that matters. What you're doing is you're taking your skill set away from the people that could genuinely benefit from the things that you can bring to the table like has a podcaster I know way more than any human should about dealing with transcriptions with AWS and</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:47:</p>

<p>having these talks with mentors where it's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:51:</p>

<p>Hey, I built a framework that does like it creates a</p>

<p>Jay 00:41:55:</p>

<p>standard schema for transcription. So matter what Web service you're using, whatever developable law. And they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:02:</p>

<p>why? I was like because you told me I needed a project that would make me hire Well, that's why. And they're like But why that when I was like, Well, it's because it's a thing that I have to deal with on a regular basis. So and as we're breaking it down and like talking about it, they're just like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:18:</p>

<p>Wait,</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:20:</p>

<p>what you built this I'm like, Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but like, you know, this is like, this is stuff that you would give, like a keynote talk on, like the whole process of building this stuff. And it's like I just had a problem that I need to solve. So I solved it. And then I realized that there was a bigger problem, so I started working on solving that, too, and they're like, Yeah, that's what developers do. Congratulations and I'm like, Well, okay, I still need a job</p>

<p>Jay 00:42:50:</p>

<p>like no one's gonna take me serious If I'm just the guy that comes up and goes, Hey, I do podcasting. Come on, let's talk about Python. Um, it and that's where it's It's so frustrating because it's like, How do we fix that? And I've literally had people telling me like</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:06:</p>

<p>you would give really good talks it, like the local conference seen and I'm like, What the hell does that mean? And they're like, Well, you know, some talks were made for conferences that have less than, like 1000 people and then some. Some talks were made for people that are not for people, but for conferences that have, like there, like Pike on Level. And I'm like, Okay, that's stupid. Like I feel like my should be good</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:30:</p>

<p>one of</p>

<p>Jay 00:43:30:</p>

<p>the people</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:33:</p>

<p>that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:35:</p>

<p>that's frustrating. That's a frustrating thing that you just described that someone said, like also, I'm gonna go and say That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:46:</p>

<p>so. And</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:50:</p>

<p>because a at Piper on not every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:55:</p>

<p>talk is Aquino.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:43:58:</p>

<p>Just just in case anyone hasn't been before, there's either. There's a handful of key notes, but when you pulled off. All the majority of the stocks are in a small room, you know. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:11:</p>

<p>talk it, Pike. On talking a local conference like you could end up with the same number of people like ends. You know, Northway Python. It's single track. So instead of you know, at high Con, where you have seven different walks, you could go to it and given time slot,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:27:</p>

<p>you know, Northway Python. There's one you're gonna end up with it a pack grim.</p>

<p>Jay 00:44:32:</p>

<p>Everybody at that conference paid to hear you talk.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. It's wonderful. So there's that element. But also</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:43:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:44:</p>

<p>I feel like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:49:</p>

<p>you never know why</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:51:</p>

<p>your talk gets turned away from any particular conference. You know, it could be that they got</p>

<p>Melanie 00:44:58:</p>

<p>a bunch of different talks on that same topic. Like it just so happens to be that way, you know? I mean, unless is it are you doing close like sleight of hand magic? Is that because I can see I can say that being like meeting a small room</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:15:</p>

<p>for this</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:15:</p>

<p>presentation, a volunteer</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:19:</p>

<p>and need a volunteer, and everyone has to be within arm's length of my body</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:24:</p>

<p>so and I don't know. I mean,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:29:</p>

<p>I think in general, in life,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:32:</p>

<p>none of us know we're doing like, ever. So when people sit down and they're like, Well, this thing is good for this circumstance, Like, you know, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:45:43:</p>

<p>none of us know what we're doing. Just admit it and go on, like with any of the stuff we're doing. We're lucky that we still exist as a species.</p>

<p>Jay 00:45:57:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And I want in this on a way more positive. Note that wherever you are now, So please tell me what's what's next for five up. Is there anything next for five up? Is it just gonna be more of the same? And I'm okay with that, too, cause I'm happy with it.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:15:</p>

<p>Um well, first is fixing the very important broken thing.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:22:</p>

<p>This so that that's sexy updates coming at you fast. Um, but there are There are some things that I've wanted to dio um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:32:</p>

<p>So there's a database that I curate of messages that go out, but you've been also every user has a personal needs, so I can send you my link, and you can put a nice message into my cue and I'll get that mixed in with the other curated ones. Um, and that's like actually a really, really fun and powerful</p>

<p>Melanie 00:46:52:</p>

<p>um, feature. What I want to do with that is make it so that you can see your past messages like your past custom ones and break you them, because right now you get it once and you never see it again. So I don't want to reveal them before you get thm. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:12:</p>

<p>because the surprise is important.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:14:</p>

<p>We like surprised, like delight is in surprise. Unless it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:20:</p>

<p>surprise your bankrupt like That's not awesome. But like surprise. I think you're a cool person. Is like is nice, you know, So I don't want to reveal them before you see them, But it's</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:31:</p>

<p>some of the custom messages that I've received, and I know that other people have received have been really</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:41:</p>

<p>like they can hold you up, you know,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:44:</p>

<p>um and so if you have the option to go back and say, like, actually, just keep that in my queue all the time, you know some that's me, every</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:51:</p>

<p>Howard along. That's that's one thing that I've been wanting to dio, um, I want to make it some people can suggest</p>

<p>Melanie 00:47:59:</p>

<p>things for the general database. And then I can</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:02:</p>

<p>say that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:03:</p>

<p>you know, I can allow them to go in because the it's like</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:08:</p>

<p>350 messages or so that are in there. But they're all ones that I've stood in. You know that I signed and thinker interesting have been there but would be nice to have other people. You know, we have a lot of men, but then it's You do have lots and Jay Peak America's like,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:24:</p>

<p>Yeah, some people have weird,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:27:</p>

<p>weird heroes out there. This is So, um</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:32:</p>

<p>you think those air</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:35:</p>

<p>I I have been wanting to, like, make it a tweet pot or so, but that's like latter. Now I would love to be able to send pictures. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:45:</p>

<p>but that's kind of it's all kind of tricky because it's this weird like, um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:48:51:</p>

<p>sent through like it sent by email to the SMTP gateway for each of the carriers, you know, for a long period. So there's a little bit of tricking us involved there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:04:</p>

<p>You mentioned using Tulio earlier, and we're definitely not gonna get too deep into the weeds here, But the</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:12:</p>

<p>Tulio a p I has that like SMS thing?</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:18:</p>

<p>Is that utilizing the same like email stuff? Or is that actually using, like a phone number type</p>

<p>Jay 00:49:25:</p>

<p>whatever.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:29:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:30:</p>

<p>abandoned twilio straightaway because it's very expensive. Um, especially if you get any number of users that are getting five messages a day legs</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:43:</p>

<p>I can't afford that is quite expensive. And so but send bread,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:49:48:</p>

<p>um, was very affordable. And so I had to kind of do this hack around to figure out how to use the S and P gateways to send The message is so like each carrier has like, a phone number at</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:01:</p>

<p>something at 18 c commune over something like this. So you email the</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:07:</p>

<p>that email address, then it comes through a text.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:11:</p>

<p>So that's what I did. And then, interestingly enough, uh, Tulio then acquired sin bread and ensure</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:19:</p>

<p>they have not jacked up saying grits, Princes, is this I know. Or maybe I've like, you know, I just got in at the right time, But, um, when I saw that, I was like, Please don't touch me more money. I do this for fun.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:33:</p>

<p>I want people to be happy. But like, not like many, many hundreds of dollars are happy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:39:</p>

<p>All of my users air happy. I am miserable because I got a 48th of happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:44:</p>

<p>Yeah, I can do that. I can't do that.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:47:</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:49:</p>

<p>yeah, that's how that works.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:50:</p>

<p>And five up is free, right?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:50:53:</p>

<p>One of his act. Yeah.</p>

<p>Jay 00:50:57:</p>

<p>Uh, though message and data rates may apply. I just saw that at the bottom.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:02:</p>

<p>Yeah, I did that stuff that</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:06:</p>

<p>doesn't say like expensive messages are not happy. I'm pretty sure I shove blood in there.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:11:</p>

<p>Ah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:12:</p>

<p>Lissy.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:13:</p>

<p>Yes? Make sure you know about your texting and data plan. Expensive messages are not happy.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:19:</p>

<p>They're not. I mean, I have a good database of messages, but, like, I don't know if they cost you 1/4. No, e, I don't know. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Jay 00:51:29:</p>

<p>Oh, man, that's too good. All right, well, let's let's get ready to button this up, cause we seven after show to get Teoh. Um, let everybody know once again, if they want to talk to you or if they want to learn more about five up, um, Or if they wanna check out any of your amazing conference talks, where can they do all of those things.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:52:</p>

<p>Let's see. So five up is five a pap dot com.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:51:58:</p>

<p>Um, I am on Twitter and, like, everywhere on the Internet almost is. Hello, Melanie C. Um, so twitters where I hang out the most, um, Facebook and I are on a break.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:11:</p>

<p>Eso don't look for me there. Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:15:</p>

<p>see what else?</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:18:</p>

<p>Five apps on Twitter. I think it's high by Bob the terrible</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:22:</p>

<p>project, Mom,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:24:</p>

<p>it's on there somewhere. You'll find it just 11.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:27:</p>

<p>Some branding thing will figure that out.</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, and then all of my talk, sir, on YouTube. So</p>

<p>Melanie 00:52:35:</p>

<p>if you want, you can keep them all up and compare each, you know, performance to the next and rate them and send it to me. And I'll get real sad about it. Never beautiful.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:47:</p>

<p>I would recommend the ah, the North Bay Python talk.</p>

<p>Jay 00:52:51:</p>

<p>Um, about how to get started. To Jingo, it was very, very funny. I heard multiple people, not just me say that it was the best talk of the entire conference, so Oh, yeah. You could definitely got that award.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:07:</p>

<p>Um,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:08:</p>

<p>yeah,</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:09:</p>

<p>it was It was a fun one. It was fun. Everything went wrong. Little preview furry you people out there the panic that you see Israel. It was not staged.</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:19:</p>

<p>Oh, I remember that. It was Yeah, that was</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:24:</p>

<p>I think I triple prepared for my talk. Because of that, I was just like, I know it works. I know everything is good. I'm just going to do it again just to make sure. And also that was their first year doing a conference. So I'm sure, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:53:40:</p>

<p>the first year versus the third year, though, should they got a lot of bugs? You know, it</p>

<p>Melanie 00:53:45:</p>

<p>wasn't them. It wasn't them. It was me. And I swear to you, I had practiced that talk so many times. And the things that went wrong that you saw had never gone wrong before. Like had not gone run 30 minutes prior. When that happens, been in the green room. It was just, you know, the stars just aligns to really make me vulnerable and sweaty, very sweaty.</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:10:</p>

<p>All right, well, thank you so much for being my esteemed guests on the show</p>

<p>Melanie 00:54:16:</p>

<p>on. And well, now</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:18:</p>

<p>I love this because I know that in a post Corentin like</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:25:</p>

<p>huge world on fire kind of thing that we're living in right now.</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:30:</p>

<p>Eventually, we will be able to sit down and</p>

<p>Jay 00:54:34:</p>

<p>have dinner and talk and laugh and do all the things that we did on the show s So I can say for one that this this isn't This isn't a bit. This isn't anything. This is This is 100% Melanie. Every time I have talked to her like I I absolutely love and enjoy our conversations. Um, no, you are also the first person to tell Meteo give a talk, so Oh, yeah, I have to thank you for that</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:04:</p>

<p>s o. Thank you so much for being on the show. And</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:09:</p>

<p>now, time for all the stuff that quote unquote pays the bills. Uh, thank you for listening. Everyone out there. I do something different that most podcasters don't. I don't ask you for money. I just ask that as you were listening to this, you weren't like doing 15 other things that you actually listen to. The things that my guest and I were talking about because</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:33:</p>

<p>we get vulnerable. We talk about our experiences when we talk about the things that matter to us and we do it in a way that We hope that it can resonate with other people out there. So</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:44:</p>

<p>I don't ask that you raider review the show. I ask that you just listen.</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:47:</p>

<p>But if you feel like you must</p>

<p>Jay 00:55:50:</p>

<p>tell me about something that I said that was obviously wrong or stupid, you can do so on Twitter at KJ. Why, Miller? I will ignore it. I will block you. Um, but if it was nice, I'll reply back and say Thanks. Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:56:03:</p>

<p>yeah. If you are a podcast or thinking about getting into podcasting, you need some help with that. You can reach out to me at info at productivity in tech dot com.</p>

<p>Jay 00:56:12:</p>

<p>And of course, thank you to my uncle. Most people don't realize that when I say that but my uncle in a diorama wallet for the use of his music, a hustler in spite of myself for the Intron Ultra music, I'm only doing this because melodious, smiling at me, and it's like, Well, she did say you have to know people, so I know people. That's how I got my break. So there we go.</p>

<p>Jay 00:56:31:</p>

<title>Elasticsearch Pinboard Script (Python)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this <a href="/my-new-job-and-what-that-means-for-all-the-things-i-do">new gig</a>, I'm hoping to learn how to help those that are using the <a href="/elastic-0">Elastic Stack</a>, especially in Python. In a recent conversation with internet's mad scientist, <a href="https://brettterpstra.net">Brett Terpstra</a>. We were talking about <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/slogger/">Slogger</a>, his retired application that he used to log his life activity into Day One. This project was eventually removed as the API for Day One changed.</p>

<p>This is something I've always enjoyed about Brett. He solves his quirky problems for him.</p>

<p>There are a few applications that are overkill or a little too creepy (exist.io) for my needs, but I did like the idea of getting an idea of "how I compute". I mean this by how I spend my time producing and collecting on the internet. One of the things that I do is collect all my twitter posts and likes and retweets in pinboard. I thought it would be great to use Pinboard's API to log and manage my own data and analyze it using the Elastic Stack. So I decided to build a <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-pinboard">script</a> that allows me (and you if you wanna) to visualize my information.</p>

<p>As with most of my projects I have built this in Python and it's not a commercial tool, but it is open-source and available for you to build and hack away on. </p>

<title>I Was Selected as a Mentee for the First Podcast Mentorship Cohort</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a firm believer that it is incredibly hard to be a <em>self taught</em> anything.</p>

<p>In fact one of the <strong>easiest</strong> ways to learn is sharing and learning from others.</p>

<p>That's why I'm happy to announce I'll be doing just that as a member of the
first cohort of the <a href="https://www.podcastmentorship.net">Podcast Mentorship Program</a>), imagined by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">Myke
Hurley</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/analogue/178">Analog(ue)</a> Myke
announced he was launching a mentorship program. I was hesitant to sign up as
I've been podcasting for about 5 years now.</p>

<p>Here's something that I recently came to terms with thanks to a great
conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieyo">Brian Douglas</a>. </p>

<h3>You need to let people help you.</h3>

<p>Myke has a decade of experience in podcasting. Many of the people that I
interview on the show have been doing what they are doing professionally for
many years and have the experience of that journey to help them grow.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/671c723f">interview with Tom Merritt</a>, he
covers a secret to his success as a community builder and podcaster. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at CNet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could all follow the steps of Tom here and get a string of jobs where you learn from
years of experience or we can learn from their years of experience and shave
off incredible amounts of time.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning with and from all of the amazing people (all who are at
different places in their career).</p>

<p>Check out each of the members and their projects.

<title>Amazing Podcasting (and Content Creation) Advice from Professional Podcasters (WIP)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Work in Progress means this Post is Mostly Done, but things could change. You can help with that by telling me your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1325700577033007104?s=21">twitter</a></p>

<p>I talked with a few friends this week and got some wonderful insights around podcasting and podcast marketing. </p>

<p>This is some next level advice from folks that use podcasting for at least part of their livelihood so if you're interested, listen up. </p>

<h3>Don't Just Wing It</h3>

<p>Would you believe I recorded the solo content for <a href="/the-power-of-personal-freedom-david-sparks-on-speaking-around-multiple-interests">this week's PIT Show</a> THREE DIFFERENT TIMES!?</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xIZku8V0y7uqk/source.gif" alt="waste time" /></p>

<p>I like to just do a thing without overthinking it. That doesn't mean that I should just get on the mic and start rambling (That's what twitter is for... 😉)</p>

<p>Even coming up with a quick 5-10 bullet outline can really make a difference in how focused content is.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/david-sparks-notes.jpeg?tr=pr-true,w-1024,h-500,fo-top" alt="David Sparks Episode Notes" /></p>

<h3>There is nothing wrong with doing a bunch of things that (seem the same).</h3>

<p>In my quest to figure out what's going on with my podcast ambitions, one of my concerns was that I would produce something that was the PIT Show but with a different name. The reality is that I want to do the PIT show but I want to be able to seperate it from the world of productivity and the world of development.</p>

<p>The tech industry is dominated by companies that pitch themselves with "It's like <em>X</em> but <em>Y</em>". I feel like I can channel that to make some really good shows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One I'm thinking of off the top of my head is the <em>AntiProductivity Show</em> (Working Title) where I talk with folks that play with Productivity tools to discover the weaknesses in their systems. It's like a productivity show but honest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Half of my listeners are <em>tech workers</em> that are interested in productivity. The other half are <em>tech enthusiasts</em> that like my spin on productivity (or lack therof and my interviews).</p>

<h3>Limited Run Shows are great! There will be a lot of those in my future!</h3>

<p>One of the things I'm doing in my day job is working to come up with seasonal and limited run content. These would be interview series and YouTube things.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of limited run and narrow focused content. Being able to do things where that are super concentrated (in theory) should allow me to have smaller but more focused audiences that will come to grow the network around me. This means that over time, people will not come for the shows and instead will come to support the work that I put out. It also means that I don't have to feel bad if every project doesn't satisfy everyone in my audience. I can put out the things I want to put out and only continue the things that have enough support to expand on it. </p>

<h3>Cut a Demo</h3>

<p>Whether you are pitching a project to a major network or just planning your next project, be sure to record a few demos. These will not see the light of day but they are a good way to get in the groove. </p>

<p>It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to give you and others an idea for what the plan is. This will help you find your show's voice better and give you something to pass to friends so that they can tell you it's a great idea!!</p>

<h3>Always Leave Them Wanting Something (to eat?)</h3>

<p>Another way to word this is that you don't have to let out EVERYTHING in one recording. Some of the best conversations I've had with folks started with a rather vague or snippet of a thought and then evolved into a larger examination into the subject.</p>

<p>I talk too much. The word count on this proves that. In fact this entire post was a newsletter email at first and turned into the first TIFOTR and this post when I realized that no one wants to have 1500 words sitting in their inbox. </p>

<p>That's another thing give them what they want. </p>

<p>Here is an example on that idea.</p>

<p>You are podcasting about an idea like, "<em>Why Cheesecake is the best pie ever</em>" (Fight me!). In the episode, you mention the variety of cheesecakes, the creaminess and the ease of preparation and cost (about 10 minutes). You could share some of your favorite recipes but instead you decide to make that a blog post (about 500 words and some good links 😋). Lastly, in a newsletter post you mention why cheesecake isn't a cake and link to your thoughts while inviting your subscribers to try and convince you otherwise. (a quick 100 words)</p>

<p>In this way you've gotten all your thoughts out, but you left your audiences wanting to engage you on the subject and a few places to start.</p>

<p>BTW I don't have a post on cheesecake and I would be fine with a frozen one from the local grocer, but those are my thoughts and those of a few friends and now you have them 😄.</p>

<title>Things I Found on the Internet Recently! (Tifotir) - 08 Nov 2020</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">sponsoring all my projects</a>! </p>

<h3>TLDR:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast - Session Manager</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asciinema.org">Asciinema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-tripod-mount-for-magsafe/">Moment Magsafe Mount</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcEBQ0K3UsQ8bzWKHKQmbw">Struthless</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yousub.info/">PocketTube</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast - Session Manager</a></h3>

<p>I've tried many a browser session manager. Most of them are good and bad in their own way. <a href="https://dotoast.com/">Toast</a> is another attempt at one. Luckily it checks all the boxes and is a great way for me to export lists when I'm doing research. Here are the important features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross Browser</li>
<li>A Sustainable Business Model</li>
<li>The ability to add to existing sessions</li>
<li>The ability to edit and rename tabs in sessions</li>
<li>The ability to rename sessions</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/toast-session.png?tr=w-500" alt="Toast Example" /></p>

<p>I think that this has some unique features that may work well with tools like <a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hook</a> as each session has it's own unique link that you can share.</p>

<h3><a href="https://asciinema.org">Asciinema</a></h3>

<p>I think that video is in many ways better than writing out steps (except for accessibility). </p>

<p>I was originally going to use t-rec which I got from one of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/10/13/web-excursions-for-october-13-2020/">Brett Terpstra's Webscursions</a>, but couldn't get rust working with my setup and just couldn't be bothered. </p>

<p>[Asciinema] is a way to record your terminal session and share it with others. You can also use the replay feature to rerun steps on your local machine (Which I'm tempted to do as a new device setup script. I shared an example of how I look at how <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller/elasticsearch-twitter-lists">I visualize data from a few of my twitter lists</a> using it.</p>

<p><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/8lnUCpYqt9FalwB3jPvexfRHz.svg" alt="asciicast" /></p>

<p>I think that in the future my project will probably feature an Ascicast video showing how to use it.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-tripod-mount-for-magsafe/">Moment Magsafe Tripod Mounts</a></h3>

<p><strong>THESE AREN'T OUT YET.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/moment-magsafe-phone-mount.jpeg?tr=w-850" alt="Moment Magsafe Tripod Mounts" /></p>

<p>I wasn't planning on getting a new phone until I saw this
[Moment Magsafe Mount]. That combined with EpocCam (now owned by Elgato) makes a wonderful quick attach/detach mount webcam using my iPhone (well the future iphone 12 something I would own).</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcEBQ0K3UsQ8bzWKHKQmbw">Struthless</a> (YouTube)</h3>

<p>[Struthless] is an awesome channel that I've found recently and have been watching a lot. Campbell Walker shares stories, insights and a kickass attitude that after watching I usually just hit the next one and keep going.</p>

<p>Here a great video about drawing a cat and a very similar feeling I have about distractions.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44H76Bbvung" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3><a href="https://yousub.info/">PocketTube</a></h3>

<p>Speaking of YouTube, I've been trying to figure out better ways to manage YouTube. </p>

<p>[PocketTube] allows you to organize YouTube channels into groups and view recent videos that are in those groups. </p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/pockettube2.png?tr=500" alt="Pockettube 2.0" /></p>

<p>This is great because I can find videos that all match a type that I'm feeling.</p>

<p>One downside to it is that is that you have to manually add each video, so I'm using a system like the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-noguchi-filing-system-keeps-paper-documents-organiz-1593529432"><em>Noguchi Method</em></a> where I just organize a channel as I subscribe to it or visit a channel that I am already subscribed to. (I am subbed to over 900 channels. I don't have that kind of time...)</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com">Brett's</a> and long time listener of his show. It was an amazing experience to have someone that I look up to in the industry have me on as their guest like <strong>I'm a professional</strong> or something. </p>

<title>TIL You can change the subject of an Email</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I'm not here to bash <em>Hey</em>. In fact I wouldn't have thought of this idea if
it weren't for them so great job!</strong></p>

<p>I was setting up my (Non-M1) mac mini to do some work and I needed to setup my
email system (currently [MailMate]). While doing this, I didn't have the "gmail" hotkeys enabled so I was trying to
figure out how to enter the search field when I hit ctrl+s and I got a very interesting window.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Mailmate%20Change%20Subject%20Box.png" alt="Change Subject Screenshot" /></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this was a feature that <em>Hey</em> was promoting as a feature.</p>

<p>Upon reading the <em>caveats</em>, I realized what MailMate was doing. Essentially it
was rewriting the mail with new headers (Which was why it was saying it would
appear as a new message in other clients.)</p>

<p>This made me realize that if this was that big of a deal you could simply forward the message to yourself with a
new subject... </p>

<p>Sometimes the solution isn't elegant. Still it's a solution.</p>

<title>PIT Podcast: Effectively Doing a Lot with Tom Merritt</title>  <description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/671c723f"></iframe>

<h2>Transcription</h2>

<p>Jay 00:00:20:</p>

<p>What's up everybody? Jay Miller here bringing another Productivity in Tech Podcast. I hope that your day has been great, and I hope that the conversation that I'm about tohave will make it even better on the line with me Today I have the host of the I Don't know if it's the first, but it is definitely in the</p>

<p>Jay 00:00:42:</p>

<p>1st 3 podcasts that I ever listened to. Tom Merritt. He is the host of the Daily Tech News Show. He is also the co host work Insanity. Current Geek East Meets West. He is a published author of The Pilot X Series, the second book Trigger, Now available for digital download. And he is also a contributor to Tech Republic.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:08:</p>

<p>Tom, Did I get Everything</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:11:</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:11:</p>

<p>know, But I do weigh too much. And to be honest, it would be ridiculous to expect you</p>

<p>Tom 00:01:16:</p>

<p>to get everything that covers more than enough. Thank you for having me, man.</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:20:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And Tom is one of the few people that have been on this show more than once. Ah, he was actually a guest on what we call the before times</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:31:</p>

<p>in that initial feed that was lost. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:34:</p>

<p>I have always looked up to you, Tom, as</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:39:</p>

<p>the</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:42:</p>

<p>like, the idea of professionalism in podcasting, whether it is the stories of, like, I think, um, smr podcast Folks have said like</p>

<p>Jay 00:01:52:</p>

<p>we have to jump in the call like, an hour early. We're going through nodes and everybody's got cues. And everything's, like all synchronized and and, you know, working with producers and and just jumping on board with patri on at a really early stage and and allowing that to</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:10:</p>

<p>basically go from an empire with Was it seen at that you were with or</p>

<p>Tom 00:02:16:</p>

<p>I was with Seen it for 2004 through 2010? Yeah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:02:21:</p>

<p>I feel like the knowledge that I have on this is like nard war level? Probably not. Nor, uh, are you familiar with not, uh what is it? Nard war? No. What's Nard war? He is a Vancouver Ah, deejay that interviews like a lot of hip hop artists and the level of research that he goes through is absolutely scary at times. He's like, back in 1991 when you were, you know, doing you know, freestyles in the Bronx. You took this picture with run d m C And what were those shoes that you're aware? And he's like, Oh, you were wearing these? Yeah, I've brought a pair of those for you today.</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:02:</p>

<p>Like, Yeah, it's crazy. The scary thing is, I didn't have to do any research. Like, you are very good at what you do in that</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:14:</p>

<p>People know what Europe Teoh. They know,</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:18:</p>

<p>like I'm always finding something new that you've done. And then I'm like, Okay, Wow. Like here. Here's this thing. And then I immediately start following it for years and years and years. Uh, can you say that that's, like, kind of the gist of Of the</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:36:</p>

<p>I don't want to say, like your product or your brand Is that</p>

<p>Jay 00:03:40:</p>

<p>do you think it's more like, Hi, I'm Tom Merit of DCNS fame. Or is it or is it now? Like I am Tom Merit and the people that know me know me.</p>

<p>Tom 00:03:49:</p>

<p>Yeah, well, so thanks, man. Appreciate all the kind words I really don't know. It's something I'm always struggling to figure out is you know, what is that position? Ah, that is most common. I generally think it's probably host of daily tech new show because that is the show that I have with the largest number of listeners, and so it's more likely that somebody knows me from that</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:11:</p>

<p>than anything else. And it is the heir to tech news today and buzz out loud, which were similar shows that I did before. So I sort of feel like when I have to introduce myself in a short period of time or if someone just asked me like, What's your show? And I don't want to get into, You know, all the side projects I have. I'll just say Daily technician Usually</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:32:</p>

<p>I forgot one. It's a thing, another</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:36:</p>

<p>that probably launched three since we started talking. That's just you can never give up</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:42:</p>

<p>well, And that was something that, you know you mentioned earlier. Is that you? It's almost assigned that you do too much. Uh, how How are you balancing all of these different things?</p>

<p>Jay 00:04:56:</p>

<p>Yeah, it's something</p>

<p>Tom 00:04:58:</p>

<p>that I enjoy doing. I mean, that that is the key to all of it is that I have very carefully ah, whittled away the things I don't enjoy doing and have luckily been able to make what I enjoy doing my work, which then means I have to find time to do all the ideas that I have. And honestly, that's something I've only just recently solved because after I left twit Ah, and they replaced me. I had to start</p>

<p>Tom 00:05:26:</p>

<p>on my own. I started as many things as possible, figuring nal of them would stick. But I needed to, you know, have a bunch of irons in the fire and most of them stuck. So for a long time, I was like, I don't have any room in my schedule to make something new And it wasn't until I brought on help for mostly for daily Tech news show,</p>

<p>Tom 00:05:47:</p>

<p>but also for we're doing a reboot of of the current Keep podcast. Ah, for that as well that I loosened up enough to be able to say, Okay, now I can take some time away from time to time. Now I can have people you know, come in and and and do some of the heavy lifting, the producing, even script writing. Ah, and that allows me to kind of back off and be able to doom or without having to burn myself out. It was it was a big thing that had to be careful of was burned out. And the key to that was learning to let go where, you know, not even just trust, cause I trust all the people I work with just being able to say yes. Okay, I will. I will. I will let go of this, even though I enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:31:</p>

<p>You know, that's that's been something that,</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:34:</p>

<p>you know, you talked about burnout. Like I feel like burnout is one of those things. It's like a mental precursor to your body, physically burning out. Oh, yeah. Um, I kind of shared a little bit of the story with you, you know, beforehand. But like, it took my body literally breaking down for me to be like, Whoa, I need to dial things back a little bit and</p>

<p>Jay 00:06:57:</p>

<p>slowly reintroduce</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:00:</p>

<p>some of the things that I miss and that I enjoy. And even now, like, productivity in tech is one of those things that every time I'm like, we're going to go on a break like by a month, I'm just like I want to do more interviews. I want toe do something else. I want to bring it out.</p>

<p>Jay 00:07:18:</p>

<p>How have you prevented yourself from not starting projects. I know that's that. That's like the tough part, because, um I think Justin McElroy said it earlier this week on one of his podcast that he's now doing woodworking. But he doesn't want to talk about it, because if he talks about it to the Internet for more than Like a minute, there will be a new podcast for him,</p>

<p>Tom 00:07:38:</p>

<p>right? Ah, it's It's tough. I mean, part of it is like you say, realizing that if you put too much stress on yourself mentally, it will affect you physically. And you know it's on all too common story that you know, you you have to have a scare</p>

<p>Tom 00:07:56:</p>

<p>to make yourself adapt to. That s so keeping that in mind and paying attention to how you feel. Ah, and sort of associating, You know, if I take a break, if I take time off, if I don't do things, if I schedule things</p>

<p>Tom 00:08:13:</p>

<p>to give myself time off, I feel better, like just making that connection, forcing yourself to make that connection, eso that you're not overworking yourself and you're not feeling guilty. In my case, I would feel guilty like I should be working I should be doing these things. I have these things I want to do. I enjoy them. Why am I not doing them? And the key was to say, Because you'll you'll hurt yourself. If you do that right, it's It's like too much of a good thing is always a danger. Ah, and and so if you enjoy doing something that that's no exception So, yeah, I mean, a</p>

<p>Jay 00:08:44:</p>

<p>I don't know what</p>

<p>Tom 00:08:45:</p>

<p>the the trick is, but I've just sort of emphasized to myself that there have to be limits. There have to be and we talk about this on work, insanity a lot. There have to be beginnings and ends to the workday. There have to be breaks where I'm not working. Ah, and I've just worked really hard to to take advantage of that and give myself permission to do that</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:04:</p>

<p>Kind of, Ah, little tech. I guess nerd is something that I did. I use its will called keyboard maestro on my Mac and at quitting time. At my day job, I get a notification that says OK, timeto to wrap it up and it will start looking at what applications I have open and after two minutes. If I haven't closed all of like my community, my email, my communication, all that's up, it will promptly save everything and close them for me and say,</p>

<p>Tom 00:09:34:</p>

<p>Wow,</p>

<p>Tom 00:09:35:</p>

<p>that's intense. Yeah, you know, I mean, you got to do what you gotta do, right?</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:39:</p>

<p>Yeah, And I think that that's That's one of the things that, like you said When you enjoy the work that you do it, it does become hard to say. Okay, I'm gonna work until this time. And then after that, there are more important things that I need to tend to, like I have my wife and my daughter and, like I I want to.</p>

<p>Jay 00:09:59:</p>

<p>I have to be aware of the time that I'm taking away from them, because if I spend all day, you know, at my computer, then all of a sudden I go in. I'm like, Oh, what's for dinner? And then I look around. It's like, Oh, wait, why's everybody asleep? And that's just that's not</p>

<p>Jay 00:10:16:</p>

<p>good. It's not healthy. It's not healthy for my family. It's not healthy for me. Ah, it's It's one of those things that it takes again. It takes learning the hard way. Ah, before you're like, OK, whatever it takes for me to make sure that I go, I'm done right now.</p>

<p>Jay 00:10:33:</p>

<p>That's what I have to dio.</p>

<p>Tom 00:10:35:</p>

<p>Yeah, I've redirected some of my energy into things that will make me feel better entered and healthier. Eso You know, instead of going on to the next computer project, I'll get up and this, You know, the past couple of months, we we planted some carrots and tomatoes. So I go out and I work in the garden. And that gets me son because my doctors like you need vitamin D and and And then I get, you know, I've got a step count that I'm trying to hit. And then so that helps me get to that. And so, you know, I take some of that goal oriented behavior and and and try to redirect it into things that will help the problem rather than exacerbating it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:16:</p>

<p>Absolutely. And I wanted to talk about that. I mean, how do you approach new things? I know that you think when we first spoke, you were launching Pilot X, and now I mean you're launching treat well. You've launched trigger at this point. I think there's some weird shipping stuff going on. Do toe?</p>

<p>Tom 00:11:34:</p>

<p>Yeah. The book in the audiobook are out there, the print books. Still in a warehouse somewhere, I think. I think they're very close to being able to visit the warehouse safely, so hopefully those will start shipping.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:45:</p>

<p>Oh, man. Never thought you'd be would be having these kinds of numbers.</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:50:</p>

<p>I can't get my books out of a warehouse. I mean, yeah, okay. It makes sense now, Um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:55:</p>

<p>but yeah, like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:11:57:</p>

<p>talk a little bit about, Like how That's very different than putting out a daily new show. Just the idea of didn't you Self published this one and the last one Or</p>

<p>Tom 00:12:08:</p>

<p>now Pilot X and Trigger are through a company called Inc Shares that is a traditional publisher, but they they use crowd sourcing for choosing the books. So you have to get a certain number of people to commit to buying the book ahead of time, and then you'll be ableto publish. And and then it works. Just like any other publisher with editors and marketing and all of that. Ah, but I did sell, publish a lot of others before and really with the books. It's just again. It's something. It's a sideline that I enjoy. I have a task for myself, too, right? Or edit every day. Ah, and so it's just built in that I'm always working on something, even if it's for 10 minutes. Ah, I just I'm always working on something. And then eventually I'll have Manu scripts and I'll want to share those. I want toe to put those out and find a way to get those into the hands of people that might want to read it,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:01:</p>

<p>including, you know, joining the ranks of of, I guess, jury fame with a free newsletter. And we're not free news that What was it Free? Tom's, Tom's</p>

<p>Tom 00:13:12:</p>

<p>three Top those letters dot com? Yeah, also, I mean really done at the behest of Justin Robbery of Jerry. Yeah,</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:19:</p>

<p>I need to get up. I've met. I've met jury once and alive show he did in San Diego with broken and it was funny and strange at the same time because we're both Harston players and I mean, you know, jury, it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:37:</p>

<p>as much of a character as he is. He's also kind of like</p>

<p>Jay 00:13:41:</p>

<p>Okay, cool. Everybody's happy I'm going to go like, take a breath and, like, step away and like you just catches me Playing Harston over in the corner is like, OK, and then, like that starts a whole conversation. I'm like, Yeah, great show data, data, data. Brian sucks sometimes because he supposed to been on this show like, three years ago. And he emailed me, like, two months ago. Like, hey was not supposed to do a thing</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:03:</p>

<p>that sounds like Brian This'll wasn't supposed to be a dig on Brian, but yeah, like it. It is so interesting. And one of the reasons why I wanted to kind of question the idea of, like, product versus brand waas</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:19:</p>

<p>You have put around you. Um and this is probably another question for, like, Scott Johnson who will have to have on the show and everyone else That's a part of this group. And, um,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:29:</p>

<p>like I won't say the diamond club, but like diamond group frog pants, Like all of these ancillary groups that are around what you're doing,</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:38:</p>

<p>it seems like there is a</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:42:</p>

<p>community that is</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:47:</p>

<p>almost like YouTube mega star esque in that</p>

<p>Jay 00:14:54:</p>

<p>you can talk about a thing such as folding at home, which, for those who don't know folding at home, was, ah, project where people could donate. Resource is on their own machine to help solve some of the algorithmic problems for figuring out a cure for covert 19 on. I think before that it was something else. But</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:15:</p>

<p>the team jumps in and then becomes, like breaks the top 100 of like groups within a matter of weeks. And</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:25:</p>

<p>it's like</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:27:</p>

<p>there isn't really a</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:30:</p>

<p>demand or request from the Group it czar from the leaders of the group. It is usually Hey, we're doing a thing. If you want to join in, Here you go. Wow, look at how many of you joined in? Has that been something that you've</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:47:</p>

<p>you've kind of grown and nurtured over time? Or is it something that just kind of, like happened?</p>

<p>Jay 00:15:53:</p>

<p>Yeah, it's It's</p>

<p>Tom 00:15:54:</p>

<p>both, Ah, the the group of podcasters that I that I, you know, have on the show and communicate with and and and cross promote with those air friends, those air people that I'm like. I not only like you, but I like what you do. Ah, and and I think that's super important Ah, as part of it, Which is when I have Allison Sheridan on my show. When I have Chris Ashley on my show, when I have Scott Johnson on my show, you can tell that that we all respect and get along with each other. And I think that makes for better content that it really does. And then that, in turn, provides an example for the community building around all of these shows to be like OK, so they're respectful. They get along with each other. Uh, let's be the same lets you know, and people who don't really want to do that kind of wander often and and do something else I've said it before is you get the audience you deserve, which is, you know, maybe a little negative wayto to express that. But I think your audience is a reflection of your product of your show of of the of how you present yourself, um,</p>

<p>Tom 00:17:07:</p>

<p>and and the community that I have has long roots. I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at Cnet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:49:</p>

<p>Well, let's</p>

<p>Jay 00:17:51:</p>

<p>I want to give some some, like actual tangible help to those out there that might be thinking of following maybe not the tech news route, but</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:03:</p>

<p>building some form of community around content that they do. What What are some of those things that I guess people starting out</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:13:</p>

<p>need to be cognizant of and ultimately need to do to? I can't say to guarantee success because that's not possible. But Teoh truly give them the best possible</p>

<p>Jay 00:18:26:</p>

<p>chance at building something similar to what you've done.</p>

<p>Tom 00:18:29:</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, some of it is luck, some of its longevity Ah, but but there there are some things I think I can pull out that might be useful to folks. Ah, and one is, you know, being genuine, being yourself being authentic. People will notice that they were, and then they will gather around that. And it will be very easy for you to maintain that because it's you Ah, and will help you avoid a lot of problems in the future because you are just being you. And so when you make mistakes, your audience will be more understanding because they know like, Oh, well, I understand him because he's always been or her or whatever. Ah, I understand them because they have been themselves with me. And so I I get what's going on, uh, also giving your community of voice. I think a super important, and it is as simple as reading emails. I mean, it could take all kinds of other forms. It could be Twitter and Instagram and Facebook groups and discords and slacks and and all of that, and those are all great ways to do it, too. But just giving your community of voice in what you do, I think, is super important. And that's one of the lessons I learned way back a tech TV like just reading someone's email on a show</p>

<p>Tom 00:19:41:</p>

<p>really does make their day. Ah, and they and they will become a fan forever</p>

<p>Tom 00:19:47:</p>

<p>in a lot of cases just because of that moment. But it also builds dialogue. And so it shouldn't just be one way. It's It should also, you know, you should be able to have conversations with people. And again it could just be over email, uh, or in chats or discords or whatever, but having</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:05:</p>

<p>some way to bring it your community into your show so that they feel a part of it. So they are a part of it and and also, uh, addressing people back so that they feel like you are, in fact listening for for at the beginning that's so easy. If you're starting out, you won't get overwhelmed. You won't have too many people writing in, so you can personally answer every email you get and</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:32:</p>

<p>you can be selective.</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:33:</p>

<p>You don't You don't have to read every single email on the show because you do want tohave. The feedback you include in the show be representative of the kind of feedback you'd want from your community. But if you're communicating back to people then you can explain that you could explain. Oh, the reason I didn't, you know, use your contribution was because of X, Y and Z.</p>

<p>Jay 00:20:51:</p>

<p>Sometimes that's</p>

<p>Tom 00:20:52:</p>

<p>difficult. Sometimes people will get upset and you have to be ready for that. That's part of community management, but it's it's really important to to try to do that. Ah, and to be transparent about how you're doing it so that people understand.</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:07:</p>

<p>You know, I think one of the</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:09:</p>

<p>most memorable times for me was probably the first time that I felt like I had any type of knowledge to contribute</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:18:</p>

<p>to D. T and s And funny enough, who was actually from the morning stream because you were in Scott we're talking about, um I want to say it was e a removing the Tetris app from the APP store and I immediately e mailed in Onley because, like a week prior to that and I'm a big Tetris fan. Um but a week prior to that, I had watched like the to our long by, like, documentary Ah, Alexey pageant not who is the creator of Tetris and so still fresh in my mind. I had all of this knowledge. And I was like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:21:53:</p>

<p>I can't wait to tell like, you know, Tom and Scott both about Like, I forgot what I remember. There was, like, something that was stated. They were like, Oh, I wonder why they're doing this or what?</p>

<p>Tom 00:22:04:</p>

<p>How the Russian government makes money from Tetris?</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:06:</p>

<p>Exactly. And I was like, Yeah, I mean, Russia. It's still kind of makes a little bit off of that. But there has been the terrorist organization and everything else that now works with Alexey Pajitnov to help. Kind of</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:21:</p>

<p>make sure he's taking care of because he can't technically get paid from Tetris because he built it using</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:28:</p>

<p>equipment that he was using when he worked for the Russian government. Um, and in the end, I think the coolest part of that was the reply emails of just like Oh, that's cool. I did not know that. And then Scott saying Now I just want to play Tetris 99.</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:44:</p>

<p>So I definitely agree that</p>

<p>Jay 00:22:47:</p>

<p>even when even when a reply like I knew my new my long winded response, there was no reason it ever needed to be aired because it was much more information than anyone could digest in, like, a couple of sentences. But just the fact that I knew that it was seen and I knew that it was responded to and it wasn't like, Oh, hey, great. Great insight. Thanks for the information. It was okay. Wow, This actually resonated Some kind of emotional feeling. And this is what that feeling Waas And to me, I thought that that meant the world to me in a way that I don't think that that you are Scot could ever imagine. Because that's what I was hoping. I was hoping that, like, I would strike a chord and be like, Oh, yeah, cool. That's awesome.</p>

<p>Tom 00:23:37:</p>

<p>Yeah. Yeah, well, and it's tough because they're gonna people be people who write in with something that they think is really important that maybe you you already know, right? Like like, if if you were doing this and someone wrote in to tell you about this this documentary about Tetris, you'd be like, Well, yeah, I already saw that. So, you know, it can be tricky. Yeah, you're not going to be able to make everybody's day all the time. Ah, but even when you just acknowledge it and And like I said, especially at the beginning, when you can like, I can't reply to every single person anymore. I try to I do read everything. I try to respond to his many as I can, but in the early times you can. And just that acknowledgement will help people, you know, really feel a part of your community.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:26:</p>

<p>Well,</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:27:</p>

<p>I have enjoyed all of the different things that we have we've talked about, but I I would definitely want to give us enough time for this last question. Because</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:38:</p>

<p>you look a tech</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:40:</p>

<p>daily. You work with your community daily. You're trying new phones. You're trying new tools.</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:49:</p>

<p>What is the state of tech for you these days? How are you feeling about</p>

<p>Jay 00:24:55:</p>

<p>how politicized technol technology companies air becoming how</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:00:</p>

<p>politicized? I guess everything is becoming these days, but that don't worry about that part. Um, but yeah, how</p>

<p>Jay 00:25:07:</p>

<p>when you look at new tech or new technology, do you think Oh, this is cool? Or do you think this is something that now I have to cover or I have to do because it's my job?</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:16:</p>

<p>Yeah, I I definitely love doing this. I love solving the puzzle of what goes in the show every day and and figuring out like what's really behind</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:27:</p>

<p>this or that story like today that the day that we're recording this and I know this will date this a little bit if you really pay attention. But, uh, they were recording this. Germany released their covert 19 app. Now I could have just said Germany released their their covert 19 contact tracing app and be done with it. But I also noticed that France</p>

<p>Tom 00:25:48:</p>

<p>was had recently had problems with their at because they were using a different platform. And I noticed that the European Union had announced they wanted to do a, ah, an interoperability project between all the different countries in Europe. And so it was funded to be like, Oh, these three stories are one story. How do I, you know, connect those dots? I just really enjoy doing that. And</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:12:</p>

<p>I feel like</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:14:</p>

<p>now I've been doing this long enough now feels, ah, lot like the early to mid two thousands because back in the early to mid two thousands, everybody was saying, Well, you know the dot com bust, That's it. You know what? What's gonna happen. There isn't anything new. These tech companies didn't work out. Ah, and that's a different thing that what we're experiencing now. But there's a similar flavor to it, which is, well, these tech companies, they're too big. They've stifled all the innovation. That's it. What do we do now? And to me, it's really exciting to be in that space where we don't know. We don't know what the next big new thing is gonna be. We don't know when the Google</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:56:</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>Tom 00:26:57:</p>

<p>Microsoft is goingto happen to Google. You know, like we these companies were the ones that disrupted the companies of the nineties. Now they're huge. Uh, who's going to disrupt them? And the fact that it's not obvious to me is exciting. It's not. It's not depressing. It's like we haven't seen him yet. It could come from anywhere. You know, the most recent thing. We have to point to his tic tac. Ah, and some people may roll their eyes and like a great chick talk, you know, a bunch of kids making videos. It's like, Yeah, but you were rolling your eyes at Facebook. If you were having that same approach in 2007. Ah, and look where that got us So I don't know it z me. It's It's super, it's super fun and it's super exciting to watch that story continue to unfold. And we're in the build up of suspense to know when the next twist is gonna happen.</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:49:</p>

<p>Well, I am personally looking forward to you covering that twist whenever it does happen, because again,</p>

<p>Jay 00:27:56:</p>

<p>de et nous, I love that you have put it in a place that it feels it feels stronger than it's ever been. It feels like it's definitely not going anywhere, anytime soon. And they even let you take a break every now and then to come on little shows like this.</p>

<p>Tom 00:28:15:</p>

<p>Ah, yeah, man, it's It's It's fun. I'm glad it feels strong. It certainly feels good from within two. And I've gone from I'll be honest, like the 1st 4 years I was just, like is gonna fall apart at any moment, and I just know it. I was gonna keep this ball in the air, keep juggling as long as I can. Ah, and have finally come around, you know, in its 60 year to being like, Oh, you know, what this means. Stick around. This</p>

<p>Tom 00:28:41:</p>

<p>may have something here, so it feels good</p>

<p>Jay 00:28:44:</p>

<p>that that's interesting that you say that because that was me for the 1st 3 years of pit. It was just like, How do I make this better? How do I make it? You know, larger numbers, bigger downloads. Maybe I can advertise all these things. And then it got toe like Year Four. And now we're in your five, and it's like,</p>

<p>Jay 00:29:04:</p>

<p>You know what? I just want to enjoy having good conversations and and you'll hear a little bit of bad up as we get ready to wrap up the conversation. But But, Tom, I've enjoyed this, but we haven't after show to get to. So before we do that, please let everyone know where they can find out about the 14 15 16 17 things that you're working on at this moment.</p>

<title>How to Automate Form Filling with Keyboard Maestro (For Big Sur)</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Working to help a friend automate some form entry I went to look back into how I had automated a similar task a few years ago with <a href="https://keyboardmastro.com">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I was surprised at how I remembered the steps to input form fields (Big props to the KM team for making it so easy to do.)</p>

<p>But when I went to test adding value to the field, I got nothing. If you're trying to automate this form filling, you may run into the same steps so hopfully this will serve as a quick guide to troubleshoot the problems you may have run into or to start automating your own form fields.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This guide uses Safari but you can use the Chrome actions to complete the same tasks.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Step 1: 🚨 Make sure Javascript can Be Ran FROM System Events 🚨</h2>

<p>Ultimately this was the issue I ran into. This setting (off by default prevents rogue applications from taking control of your browser). In most cases this is a great security measure but in our case, it breaks the Keyboard Maestro functionality.</p>

<h3>For Safari</h3>

<p>With Safari open go to <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the advanced column.</p>

<p>Check the box <em>Show Develop menu in menu bar</em></p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Show%20Develop%20Menu%20from%20MenuBar.png" alt="check the box show develop menu in menu bar" /></p>

<p>In the menu bar select the <em>Develop</em> menu and select the option <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Allow%20Javascript%20from%20Apple%20Events.png" alt="Enable Javascript from Apple Events" /></p>

<h3>For Chrome</h3>

<p>Chrome makes this a little easier. In the menu bar select <em>View</em>, then <em>Develop</em> (already visible) and select <em>Allow Javascript from Apple Events</em>.</p>

<p>In both cases, you will see a check mark that indicates you are ready to Automate!</p>

<h2>Step 2: Find the XPath of the field you want to Enter</h2>

<p>This is where the magic happens 🧙🏾‍♂️. Finding the right field to target with information can be a challenge as websites come in many different sizes and accesssibility forms.That said you can use the tools built into Keyboard Maestro or the browser to find the correct XPath.</p>

<p>Don't worry too much about what an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath">XPath</a> is. You just need to know how to find it. </p>

<h3>Using Keyboard Maestro</h3>

<p>In Keyboard Maestro, when you select the <em>Set Safari Field to Text</em> the <em>Safari ˇ</em> will look for forms on the active tab of in your browswer and show all of the input fields available. Find the field that you want to automate with text and select it. Enter the text you wish to fill in. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Set%20Safari%20Field.png" alt="Choosing the XPath from Keyboard Maestro" /></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: There is also a checkbox version of this that works exclusively for checkboxes</strong></p>

<h3>Using Safari/Chrome</h3>

<p>If you have a lot of fields that you want need to identify you can figure out the exact text field you want to add to by right-clicking the field in your browser and selecting <em>Inspect Element</em> (<em>Inspect</em> for Chrome) to view the source code. </p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Safari%20Inspect%20Element.png" alt="inspect element" /></p>

<p>Then in the inspector you can right click the highlighted code-block and hover over <em>copy</em> and select <em>XPath</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Copy%20XPath.png" alt="copy XPath" /></p>

<p>Repeat this step as many times as you like for each field. Finally, add a submit field.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Form%20Automation/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Submit%20Safari%20Form.png" alt="Submit Form" /></p>

<title>Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the Quarantine, I've been goign on two weekly walks with a couple of PIT
Premium Members.</p>

<p>This allows me to do a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Catch up/Learn more with members of my community</li>
<li>Get some exercise</li>
<li>Vent about whatever it is I need to vent about.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been struggling to keep weight off as my asthma has been worsening with
the weight gain. If my friends are not available, I tend to take this route
with my headphones in and use the time to decompress or just think about
things. Also the time away from my computer really helps.</p>

<title>Introducing DiversityOrgs.Tech</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Okay Time to Share something I've been working on for the last month. Introducing https://diversityorgs.tech.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wanted to build something that did a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Created a place where underrepresented folks in tech could find groups that wanted to represent them.</li>
<li>Create a resource for new underrepresented folks and allies could learn how to get connected.</li>
<li>Build something fun and simple with technology that I haven't played around with too much.</li>
</ol>

<p>Diversityorgs.tech does all these things.</p>

<hr />

<p>To use it, simply search. You can search for things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>your city, state, territory, or region</li>
<li>the group in which you identify with (or wish to support)</li>
<li>A technology, focus or stack</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I don't do anything like require user accounts. There's no cookies, trackers and I have none of your information, nor do I want it. There's no need for that. This site is pretty lightweight and free. </p>

<p>It's just the beginning so there are only about 150 organizations that have been added (most around the python space because that's where I operate).</p>

<hr />

<p>I desperately want to add more orgs to this and create some interesting features. That said it's easy to add organizations, but not always easy to find. If you represent an organization and would like it added to this. Please:</p>

<p>A. Message/DM me on twitter
B. Use this link to submit your org through the app - https://diversityorgs.tech/addorg</p>

<title>Kaotica Eyeball</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I first learned about the <a href="https://www.kaoticaeyeball.com">Kaotica Eyeball</a> from a video by Hip Hop Artist <a href="">Ruslan</a>. In the video he mentioned using it to record vocals that would later appear on one of his albums. While consulting for a former employer, I took the opportunity to order one for them to record in their office. I was impressed with the quality of the acoustic foam and how well it blocked out noise. I hoped that I could use it to block out some unwanted noise from our (and our neighbor's) dogs.</p>

<p>I was saddened to still have the barks come through in our recording. While I thought about returning the eyeball, I decided to use the recording and I'm happy to say that it improved the quality of my audio in a few ways.</p>

<p>I guess I'll be keeping the eyeball. If you want to hear how it sounds, check out this <a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/25">episode of the PIT Show</a>.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/6ecb6cf5"></iframe>

<p>In that episode I removed my normal <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx/features.htmll">RX Plugins</a>:
- Vocal De-Noise
- De-Reverb
- De Plosive</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Audio Chains.png" alt="RX Audio Chains" /></p>

<p>This retained some of the natural quality in the recording. While I don't think many people would notice a difference in quality, there is definitely a difference. But this also reduces my processing time and resources required on podcast and videos.</p>

<p>I am not ready to say that this is the $200 solution that every producer would need, but for those home-studio podcasters whose space is being encroached on in during the pandemic it will definitely be a help (albeit expensive) to improve audio on your track.</p>

<title>Friends have been my Greatest Asset!</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been letting folks know about my <a href="https://productivityintech.com/coaching">coaching</a> and <a href="https://productivityintech.com/editing">editing</a> services more and more these days. </p>

<p>It's been a slow progressing growth. This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. </p>

<h2>Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.</h2>

<p>I've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. </p>

<p>100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis <strong>or</strong> they were recommended by the aforementioned person.</p>

<p>While I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.</p>

<p>I know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. </p>

<h2>Ways to do this</h2>

<h3>1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.</h3>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg" alt="" />
<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small></p>

<p>One of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. </p>

<p>Each of them have their own reach and their own network. 
I've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. </p>

<p>I've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. </p>

<h3>2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method</h3>

<p>Some relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the <a href="https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/">Noguchi Filing Method</a>. </p>

<p>The Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. 
<img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. </p>

<h3>3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)</h3>

<p>I got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and "unicorn" services.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a list of the services I provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My skills include:
  - social media
  - recording videos and screencasts
  - podcast editing and recording
  - community management
  - newsletter publishing</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. </p>

<p>I didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.</p>

<p>One person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.</p>

<p>The other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. </p>

<p>================</p>

<p>None of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this <em>grimy</em> feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your "inner-circle" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.</p>

<title>January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year I made the decision to go full time analog productivity. To me this was a return to my <em>Midori Traveller's Notebook</em> and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. </p>

<p>With January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. </p>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<p>Since I've been reading [<em>The Bullet Journal Method</em>][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. </p>

<p>This time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in <em>Marie Kondo</em> style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were "essential" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. </p>

<p>With the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.</p>

<p>Another big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  </p>

<h3>What didn't go so well</h3>

<p>There is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. </p>

<p>Another failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. </p>

<h3>My thoughts going into February</h3>

<p>February is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.</p>

<title>Pricing People Out</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time I quoted someone out of my market. It wasn't that I didn't want to work with them. In fact I've been working on securing the client for some time.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/Screen-Shot-2019-08-06-at-10.31.26-AM.png" alt="twitter exchange" /></p>

<p>My pricing wasn't me being greedy. It was me trying to be realistic with the amount of work I put into an edit and the time I had available.</p>

<p>In fact it was me trying to establish my value as a content editor.</p>

<p>I had under sold myself time and time again to get to a position where I thought I could be competitive in the market. Much of this comes from the research I had done looking at competitors and what I brought to the table with my personal touches of:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping the customer included in the process</li>
<li>openness</li>
<li>transparency</li>
</ul>

<p>To some this is something they value. These are the people that have held onto editing their projects evaluate they like the "total control" over their work. To them I am a middle of the road. I'm not someone who can do it better, I'm someone who can do it <em>close enough</em> to how they would have done it.</p>

<p>To the ones that <em>can't be bothered to do it themselves</em> I'm just the option they chose.</p>

<p>Neither one of these is the "dream" client that I've had in my mind. The person that listened to the latest [PIT Podcast] and said "wow 😮! This guy edits his own stuff and it sounds amazing!! (Although at times I know it's merely passable). He obviously loves doing this and I want him to show that same love and care on my content."</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0Ex4jlxBVvVX38xG/giphy.gif" alt="Obama" /></p>

<p>But I have something very special. I have creators that, over time, come to appreciate not just the work that I do for them but the willingness to provide feedback on how they can improve their process. People that I talk not just about podcasting or course creating but cross industry marketing strategies that allow you to grow your network but also not be disgusting about it. People that trust me to develop per customer processes and templates and share them with my clients so if they choose they could do the work themselves or (God forbid) take the work I've done and hand it to someone cheaper and have them do it for the rates I started at.</p>

<p>There's a [great video] that mentions how to come up with pricing for service work. I do believe I've reached a price point I'm comfortable charging my clients. But now I need to put the pieces in motion to start finding and landing more folks like them.</p>

<title>Fish Resources</title>  <description><![CDATA[<div class="notification is-dark">
<div class="content">
<h2 class="has-text-light">Update:</h2>
<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<p>I do a lot of work in the terminal. I understand that for many it's the lack of glitz and glamour that keeps people away from it, and while the majority of my computer usage is in some GUI, there are still many things that I can do much faster using a script that I can launch from my terminal.</p>

<p>Fish (Short for Friendly Interactive Shell) was a great attempt to add some modern-ness to the terminal environment. That said it has been around since the 90's as this boutique experience that some love, many ignore, and even more fear. </p>

<p>Well, fear not. Here are a few links that can help introduce you to fish and help you get out the gate quickly.</p>

<title>5 People that made my 2020 🔥</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>I've mentioned this before. As much as 2020 sucked for the world, it was one of my biggest professional years of growth.</p>

<p>Most of this growth came from connecting and communicating with some amazing folks in my extended digital community.</p>

<p>This was originally a podcast episode, but since I was experiencing some audio issues I decided to convert this into a blog post celebrating some people that made an huge impact on me in 2020.</p>

<h2><a href="https://compassionatecoding.com">April Wensel</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/AprilWensel-about.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="April Wensel" /></p>

<p>April Wensel is the founder of <a href="https://compassionatecoding.com">Compassionate Coding</a>, a company focused on increasing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0kzU4Pu-Q">emotional intelligence</a> of developer teams. April and I connect regularly with each other as 2020 impacted us in many ways. April was a foundational part of #GetJayADevJob and has even helped to make some amazing connections to get my first few months as a Dev Advocate off to a great start.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.willingconsulting.com">Carol Willing</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/carolwilling-twitter.jpg?tr=w-400" alt="Carol Willing" /></p>

<p>Carol was the first person to comment on one of my coding projects. This was back in 2014 when I was just learning Python and my code wasn't wonderful. Still, Carol saw beyond my non-perfect code and saw the practicality of the work.</p>

<p>Fast forward 6 years Carol reached out to me asking to help me on my job journey. She provided great resume advice and has kept up with what I've been working on. She's even helped me think about some of the <a href="https://render-engine.site">Render Engine</a>.</p>

<p>Carol is a great leader in the Python community and has mentored many great folks in the tech industry. I am glad to be included in her illustrious list.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/caffodian">Alex Tsai</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/AlexTsai-twitter.jpg?tr=w-400" alt="Alex Tsai" /></p>

<p>I will be honest, Alex was someone that I met in the middle of my job hunt because I was hoping to work for him. That said, even when I took a different role I was worried it would destroy the relationship that I had made with him. That said I feel like we've spoken more since.</p>

<p>Alex also gave me great advice for my resume and has also been a great Python mentor. I hope that I can find ways to work with Alex in the future but I know, if that doesn't happen, then Alex and I will still continue to connect with one another.</p>

<h2><a href="https://bdougie.live">Brian Douglas</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/briandouglas-linkedin.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="Brian Douglas" /></p>

<p>Brian and I have known each other for several years but this was the year where we connected most and it came at a time where I was looking for an advocate that I could learn from.</p>

<p>Brian was one of the first advocates that I met that was able to successfully pivot from on stage presenting to regular streams. He's been creating a wonderful community and tools for <a href="https://opensauced.pizza">helping folks contribute to open source</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/alexcox">Alex Cox</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/AlexCox-SpaceHelmet.jpeg?tr=w-400" alt="Alex Cox" /></p>

<p>I've wanted to interview Alex for years! Now that it's finally happened (This weeks episode of <em>the PIT show</em>!). </p>

<p>Alex is a wonderful person that has so much experience. They've been podcasting since before it was cool. They've evolve their mentality around productivity, learning, experimentation and progress. It's amazing that they are able to shape and impact folks considered legendary in tech podcasting. </p>

<p>Accompanying their technical prowess, they also are a wealth of knowledge and understanding in challenging life-topics such as mental-health, gender, and transitions. On top of that, Alex has the ability to ask questions that get to the heart of the matter. This is an excellent skill that I hope I can improve on.</p>

<p>More than anything, since recording with Alex we've kept in touch and I've learned a ton from them.</p>

<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>

<h3>You</h3>

<p>I mean this. I've met so many wonderful people this year that have been nothing but supportive to me. I don't have the largest audience on the internet so if you are reading this, we've probably spoken at least once. </p>

<p>If we haven't spoken yet, be sure to <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a>. </p>

<title>How to Not 🌋 your Project</title>  <description><![CDATA[<h1>Talk Slides</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Volcano - Take a small issue in git and have it erupt into a massive issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER DO<br><br>&quot;Me: Now to add these 2 days of code to GitHub.<br><code>git add .</code><br>whoops I added environment vars lets just revert...&quot;<br><br>2 days of work <a href="https://t.co/346grNXfUz">pic.twitter.com/346grNXfUz</a></p>&mdash; Jay Miller - #BlackLivesMatter (@kjaymiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1350241433836351489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>How to solve this problem</h2>

<p>[.column]</p>

<h3>If you pushed to github.</h3>

<p>Sorry gonna have to delete that repo in GH. To really clean the history.</p>

<p>[.column]</p>

<h3>If you didn't...</h3>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rm -rf .git
git init
</code></pre></div>

<hr />

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who just spent the last 3 hours trying to squash a commit (I accidentally uploaded some CSV files and it&#39;s making the pulls take much longer and they are unnecessary)<br><br>The same person that couldn&#39;t get it to work.

<title>I Can&#39;t Be the Only One Seeing This</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p>What are people yelling about?</p>

<p>I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to give a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regarding how their policy affected underrepresented groups. </p>

<p>The responses were:</p>

<ul>
<li>people praising the OP for their bravery</li>
<li>people shouting "What about candidate z?"</li>
<li>people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do</li>
<li>People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their own agenda</li>
</ul>

<p>The fear I have is, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at. In the end NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED.</p>

<p>I don't even know looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity? ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZbUOH7pbDiNSmU1x4o/giphy.gif" alt="My thoughts" /></p>

<p>I'm considering checking out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networking opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth dealing with the things I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. </p>

<ul>
<li>Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity</li>
<li>Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis</li>
<li>Cats doing amazing tricks</li>
<li>Videos of people failing so hard</li>
<li>Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques</li>
<li>Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle</li>
<li>People motivation folks around them that are crying out for help</li>
<li>People crying out for help!</li>
<li>People that are openly doubt their knowledge but are still putting themselves out there because they hope people will support them.</li>
<li>People building things to learn and are wanting feedback</li>
<li>People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems</li>
</ul>

<p>The guys at <a href="https://internetfriends.show">Internet Friends</a> proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.</p>

<p>"I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day."</p>

<p>To expand on that, I would love it so that you can only see the replies. If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.</p>

<p>I've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). </li>
<li>I'm tired of being told to yell at people. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm just SO TIRED. 😭</p>

<p>Dear Social Media Companies:
    I don't care about followers anymore.</p>

<pre><code>Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. 

I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line. 

Don't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?
</code></pre>

<p>Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. </p>

<p>I'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.</p>

<p>I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.</p>

<p>The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. </p>

<p>... OK BOOMER ...</p>

<p>Here's an update on my health.  It's short because I'm sleepy I may update more later.</p>

<h2>Physical Health</h2>

<p>Pre-Diabetic!? ME!? OH NO....</p>

<p>On a diet (sips Pepsi), it's going as good as 2020 could make it. (No excuses I have been counting calories and trying to change my habits).</p>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>

<p>Finally going to therapy. Only had one session so don't know anything yet.</p>

<h2>Professional Health</h2>

<p>Work's good. I'm challenging myself and pushing our team to do new things. They like it. I like it sweet!</p>

<title>May 2020 - Monthly Catchup</title>  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is also available via my <a href="https://buttondown.email/productivityintech">Newsletter</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Monthly Catchup</h1>

<p>Speaking of Ketchup, here are some <a href="https://sharedappetite.com/recipes/10-creative-artisan-ketchup-flavors/">Artisan Ketchup Ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>Productivity in Tech Podcast</h2>

<p>This month on the [PIT Podcast] I interviewed my good internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl">Christina Morrillo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/pit-v3.jpg" alt="pit podcast" /></a></p>

<h2>The Biz</h2>

<p>Business has been good. I'll be talking about this in my [premium newsletter] where I break down how I run my business, the workflows the code, the everything (but the clients). </p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>"<em>In these Troubled Times</em>" 🤮</p>

<p>Just Kidding. Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. </p>

<p>I've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.</p>

<p>This Month, I purchased <a href="https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a>. I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other <a href="https://devontechnologies.com">DevonTechnologies</a> Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.</p>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/CleanShot-2020-05-25-at-23.34.03.png" alt="DevonThink" /></p>

<h2>Posts</h2>

<li><a href="https://kjaymiller.com/qtp-family-agenda">Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Render Engine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my [personal blog]</li>
<li>Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.</li>
<li>Support for Categories and Tags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcriptor</h3>

<p>I launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. </p>

<h3>Episde-DL</h3>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/">Episode-DL</a> is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.</p>

<h3>Following Me</h3>

<p>You can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>If you have an RSS Reader that you use. Consider Subscribing to my [Blog] or [Microblog].</p>
