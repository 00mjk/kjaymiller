            <p>Normally awards like this are reserved for the very last post of the year, but as I'm hoping to fulfill my commitment on <a href="https://relay.fm/conduit/12">Conduit</a> and try not to work on my time off<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p><a href="./five-people-that-made-2020-fire">Last year</a> I did the <strong>Jay-sies</strong> as a way to highlight some people in my life that have really impacted and encouraged me. My goal is to showcase 5 friends and let them know how amazing they are!</p>

<p>These are not in any order because I don't rank my friends.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/webology">Jeff Triplett</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/webology.jpg" alt="Jeff Triplett" /></p>

<p>I was surprised that Jeff wasn't on my list last year. I owe my job to him<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Jeff has been consistently awesome so I'm going to give him the nod this year for sure!</p>

<p>When I moved into tech, there were a lot of things I didn't know. Jeff is my advisor in many ways. He is also my late night coding buddy, a sharer of many new tools and someone that entertains all of my crazy thoughts and works to turn them into minimum viable ideas<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/mrssoup">Kathy Campbell</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/mrssoup.jpg" alt="Kathy Campbell" /></p>

<p>The Homie! The partner in crime. The person other than my spouse that puts up with the most ðŸ’© from me!</p>

<p>Kathy and I started <a href="https://relay.fm/conduit">Conduit</a> this year and it's been a blast getting to know her better. She inspires me to improve my community management skills (and my writing skills ðŸ˜‰). Kathy, I can truly say you have helped make dreams come true for me! Thank you for that.</p>

<p>Also, don't let her know that she's a total badass and is going to continue to grow in the space and I'm so jealous at times!</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/heyscottyj">Scotty Jackson</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/nestedfolderspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scotty.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Scotty Jackson" /></p>

<p>The pattern of people that I talk to on a regular basis continues! Scotty and I talk almost daily and share in our journey of productivity! </p>

<p>When I started talking about productivity on the internet I hoped I could have amazing conversations with people that pushed me to be more productive! Scotty is the embodiment of the person I imagined having regular conversations with.</p>

<p>BAM!</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/verso">Kelly Guimont</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/kellyguimont.jpeg" alt="Kelly Guimont" /></p>

<p>Kelly is my reality check in many ways! She is someone that I looked at as a podcaster and thought, "Wow! It would be great to work with someone like that and produce regular amazing content!". Nowadays, I build and help build automations for Kelly and help her produce that regular amazing content!</p>

<p>Kelly thank you for the ideas on home automation! Helping me develop my explaining skills and always knowing about the new hotness in apple accessory gadgets.</p>

<h2>Blue Sky Dragon</h2>

<p><em>No Image in Respect to Privacy</em></p>

<p>Oh Sky..... </p>

<p>I hope Sky knows how amazing they are. Listening to their fascination with math[s] and their inquisitiveness and fascination with many of the things I enjoy as well. Their show <a href="https://anchor.fm/find-my-dragon">Find My Dragon</a> quickly became one of my favorite new shows in 2021.</p>

<p>I wanted to add Sky because the journey is just begining for them. They are someone that I am intrigued by in many ways. I would love to do a <em>Rec Diffs</em>-style show with them one day in the future!</p>

<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p>These folks were close but I didn't add for personal reasons. They could be added in the future.</p>
