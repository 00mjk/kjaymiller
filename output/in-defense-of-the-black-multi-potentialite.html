  <p><em>Stay in Your Lane.</em> - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Shut up and Dribble.</em> - Laura Ingraham</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why does every black actor gotta rap some. I don't know. All I know is I'm the best one.</em> - Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.</p>

<p>For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.</p>

<p>For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. </p>

<p>I joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>But Why</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what is a man, what has he got?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not himself, then he has naught</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say the things he truly feels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And not the words of one who kneels</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The record shows, I took the blows</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. </p>

<p>In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.</p>

<p>When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).</p>

<p>In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.</p>

<h3>I do a lot.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I work a Day job.</li>
<li>I manage a <a href="https://productivityintech.com">side business</a> helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/kjaymiller">write code</a>.</li>
<li>I host a range of <a href="/projects">podcasts</a> from tech to gaming.</li>
<li>I'm a member of an Esports organization and <a href="https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller">stream regularly</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My <em>coding</em> skills help me <strong>automate</strong> and <strong>optimize</strong> my day job.</p>

<p>My <em>day job</em> skills, challenge me to <strong>think differently</strong> and <strong>shake up stale thought</strong>.</p>

<p>My <em>podcasting</em> and <em>streaming</em> skills gave me the ability to identify ways that <strong>I could help my
side-business clients</strong> in <strong>their</strong> content-creating journey.</p>

<p>They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. </p>

<p>I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. </p>

<p>Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.</p>

<p>Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.</p>

<p>My child will grow up seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.</p>
