            <p>I'm so confused. What are people yelling about. 
I scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to have a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regards their benefit to an underrepresented group. </p>
<p>The responses were:</p>
<ul>
<li>people praising OP for their bravery</li>
<li>people shouting "What about candidate z?"</li>
<li>people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do, not what they did do</li>
<li>People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their position</li>
</ul>
<p>The fear I have with this is that, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at and NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE WAS PROVIDED. My Tho</p>
<p>I genuinely don't know why I even looked at the thread. Maybe I was hoping for an inkling of humanity.
<img alt="My thoughts" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZbUOH7pbDiNSmU1x4o/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>My Anxiety is making me want to check out from ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networkings opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth all the people talking about things that I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. </p>
<ul>
<li>Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity</li>
<li>Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis</li>
<li>Cats doing amazing tricks</li>
<li>Videos of people failing so hard</li>
<li>Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques</li>
<li>Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle</li>
<li>People motivation folks around them that are cry out for help</li>
<li>People crying out for help!</li>
<li>People that are so anti-professional that they are openly doubting their knowledge but still putting it out there because they hope people will support them.</li>
<li>People building things to learn and are wanting feedback</li>
<li>People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The guys at <a href="https://internetfriends.show">Internet Friends</a> proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.</p>
<p>I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day. </p>
<p>To expand on that, I would love it so that only you see the replies. If they are hateful you never hear from them again.</p>
<p>I've met so many wonderful people and seen so many wonderful things because of social media, but I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). I'm tired of being told to yell at people. I'm just SO TIRED. üò≠</p>
<p>Dear Social Media Companies:
    I don't care about followers anymore, I don't care about following. Platforms don't try and help me by injecting recommendations. Don't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. I know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line, but don't you realize the pain you cause people. Does that mean nothing to you. </p>
<p>Another tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want quiet, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing all the wonderful people and benefits that social is the only way I can truly find. </p>
<p>I literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occaisional life changing connections.</p>
<p>I'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.</p>
<p>The perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow milleneals. </p>
<p>... OK BOOMER ...</p>
