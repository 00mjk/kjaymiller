<h1>Monthly Catchup</h1>

<p>Speaking of Ketchup, here are some <a href="https://sharedappetite.com/recipes/10-creative-artisan-ketchup-flavors/">Artisan Ketchup Ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>Productivity in Tech Podcast</h2>

<p>This month on the [PIT Podcast] I interviewed my good internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl">Christina Morrillo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://podcast.productivityintech.com/s2020/5"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/pit-v3.jpg" alt="pit podcast" /></a></p>

<h2>The Biz</h2>

<p>Business has been good. I'll be talking about this in my [premium newsletter] where I break down how I run my business, the workflows the code, the everything (but the clients). </p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>"<em>In these Troubled Times</em>" ðŸ¤®</p>

<p>Just Kidding. Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. </p>

<p>I've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.</p>

<p>This Month, I purchased <a href="https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a>. I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other <a href="https://devontechnologies.com">DevonTechnologies</a> Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Render Engine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my [personal blog]</li>
<li>Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.</li>
<li>Support for Categories and Tags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transcriptor</h3>

<p>I launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. </p>

<h3>Episde-DL</h3>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/">Episode-DL</a> is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.</p>

<h3>Following Me</h3>

<p>You can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>If you have an RSS Reader that you use. Consider Subscribing to my [Blog] or [Microblog].</p>
