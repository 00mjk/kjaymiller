About once a year I take the personality test [16pesonalities.com][1]. 



I do this because over time my behavior has changed and now that I&#39;m seeking professional help and using prescribed medication to alter my natural mood and behavior it&#39;s important to understand how I do my best work. 



I also ask my coaching clients to take this test as well. The idea came from my friend [Kari Beaulieu][2] from Appfluence. During a conversation, she mentioned that her employees take this test so that their managers have an idea of how to better manage the employees. 



Some people need more positive reinforcement. Some can be left alone and trusted to do great work. Some will take criticism and feedback very negatively.  Many of the factors that contribute to these behaviors are based on upbringing as well as their social and economic status in both the past and present. 



So what does my personality say about me? you can read that here, but essentially here is the gist.



- I don&#39;t like Working or talking with others, I will value the facts over emotions

- I&#39;m very charismatic, when I want to be. it takes a lot out of me though so don&#39;t expect it all the time.

- I absorb myself in things I find interesting.

- Even though I don&#39;t enjoy working on a team, it is often important for me to have one so that I don&#39;t get carried away or blinded by the pursuit of perfection. 

- My coping mechanism for my anxiety is avoidance and destruction. I will put relationships in jeopardy just to not feel uncomfortable. 



Now that you know a bit more about me, I ho-e that you will work to identify how you best thrive.
