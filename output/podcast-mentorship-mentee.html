            <p>I'm a firm believer that it is incredibly hard to be a <em>self taught</em> anything.</p>

<p>In fact one of the <strong>easiest</strong> ways to learn is sharing and learning from others.</p>

<p>That's why I'm happy to announce I'll be doing just that as a member of the
first cohort of the <a href="https://www.podcastmentorship.net">Podcast Mentorship Program</a>), imagined by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">Myke
Hurley</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/analogue/178">Analog(ue)</a> Myke
announced he was launching a mentorship program. I was hesitant to sign up as
I've been podcasting for about 5 years now.</p>

<p>Here's something that I recently came to terms with thanks to a great
conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieyo">Brian Douglas</a>. </p>

<h3>You need to let people help you.</h3>

<p>Myke has a decade of experience in podcasting. Many of the people that I
interview on the show have been doing what they are doing professionally for
many years and have the experience of that journey to help them grow.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/671c723f">interview with Tom Merritt</a>, he
covers a secret to his success as a community builder and podcaster. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at CNet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could all follow the steps of Tom here and get a string of jobs where you learn from
years of experience or we can learn from their years of experience and shave
off incredible amounts of time.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning with and from all of the amazing people (all who are at
different places in their career).</p>

<p>Check out each of the members and their projects.
