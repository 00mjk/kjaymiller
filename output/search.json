To me this was a return to my _Midori Traveller's Notebook_ and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. \n\nWith January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. \n\n### What went well\nSince I've been reading [_The Bullet Journal Method_][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. \n\nThis time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in _Marie Kondo_ style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were \"essential\" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. \n\nWith the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.\n\nAnother big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  \n\n### What didn't go so well\nThere is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. \n\nAnother failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. \n\n### My thoughts going into February\nFebruary is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.", "title": "January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap", "date": "2019-02-01T16:00:00-08:00", "category": "Analog", "tags": "['bullet journal', 'reflection']", "slug": "january_2019_bullet_journal_recap", "url": "/january_2019_bullet_journal_recap", "date_published": "Fri, 01 Feb 2019 16:00:00 -0800", "date_friendly": "Feb 01, 2019 16:00 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"_content": "I had the privilege of meeting Melanie C. very early in my python career.

J. Miller here back with another productivity in tech podcast. I hope you're having a fantastic week and mine just got a little bit better because I have the wonder and privilege to talk to someone that I have known for\n\nJay 00:00:36:\n\nGod like six years now And one of the first people I met when I became a programmer Ah always brings a smile to my face to see them Talks are absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And also just a generally overall just glowing person. Not because the radioactive, but because they just know how to brighten up a room. I am talking with the one the only Melanie crutch build. Melanie is so good to see you.\n\nMelanie 00:01:09:\n\nWow, I The glowing, I think is like I think this is just fire of, like, embarrassment on my face now because you know\n\nJay 00:01:19:\n\nthe first of a nice say, like San Diego wildfires like G, it's like, well, not really\n\nMelanie 00:01:24:\n\nknow Now I think it\n\nJay 00:01:26:\n\nstarted. I guess so,\n\nMelanie 00:01:29:\n\nYeah, we're we're hanging in there so far like\n\nMelanie 00:01:33:\n\nit's funny. It didn't quite into my consciousness that we have like yet another plague that we could layer onto 2020 like he's, you know, like of the seven layer salad of For that, 2020 is becoming like fires. I almost forgot, J thank you.\n\nJay 00:01:54:\n\nUnder, I\n\nMelanie 00:01:55:\n\nguess.\n\nMelanie 00:01:57:\n\nAh,\n\nMelanie 00:01:58:\n\n2020. Bless it.\n\nJay 00:02:00:\n\nYes. So other than the obvious, um, perils that air plaguing America right now. How have you been? Generally?\n\nMelanie 00:02:12:\n\nUh,\n\nMelanie 00:02:13:\n\nyeah. Well,\n\nMelanie 00:02:16:\n\num\n\nMelanie 00:02:18:\n\nokay, so my my measurements of how I'm doing might be slightly different than the average person. Like if I\n\nMelanie 00:02:30:\n\nand awake\n\nMelanie 00:02:32:\n\nand I have clothes on my body Bonus bonus. Both of those air working today, I have fed my cells.\n\nMelanie 00:02:41:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:02:44:\n\nyeah, and I got a couple of things done today. I mean, that's like, I'm like, living my best life\n\nMelanie 00:02:50:\n\nat that point.\n\nMelanie 00:02:52:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:02:54:\n\nbecause, like,\n\nMelanie 00:02:56:\n\nit is, uh, often that those are not my days. You know, um, that they don't quite look like that because of, um because I have major depressive disorder. Um, I also have, like a really fun and exciting relationship with migraines, So there's that I have the anxiety. I have epilepsy, which is is fun,\n\nMelanie 00:03:23:\n\nthat it's well controlled, so it's not as it's not as interesting or imitating as it might be. otherwise so, um,\n\nMelanie 00:03:31:\n\nbut the, you know, the depression really gives you a completely different, um, scale of success,\n\nMelanie 00:03:38:\n\nI guess. Is what what I might call it. So\n\nJay 00:03:43:\n\nas someone who often has to tell people in social environments of like, hey, if I start laughing really hard, can you just make sure I don't collapse? Um, I can relate. Um, that has the last few years ever since, you know, cardiac episode after cardiac episode,\n\nJay 00:04:02:\n\nyou do start to take a lot of things that other people I guess we take for granted. You, like, treat them as this has been a good day. I haven't blacked out in five days like OK, that is that is like an awesome feeling. All\n\nMelanie 00:04:17:\n\nright.\n\nJay 00:04:17:\n\nSo I can I can totally relate\n\nJay 00:04:21:\n\nto where you're coming from their Well,\n\nJay 00:04:24:\n\ndo me a favor, because I know you well, but the people listening to the show probably don't know you as well as ideo. So kind of Introduce yourself. Let people know who you are, what you do and, uh, ultimately like, what brings you joy in the tech space?\n\nMelanie 00:04:42:\n\nOh, good gracious. OK,\n\nJay 00:04:43:\n\njust some smiles, you know?\n\nMelanie 00:04:45:\n\nYeah, Just anybody stuff? Um, let's see. I am a python and jingle developer.\n\nMelanie 00:04:53:\n\nUm, I am self taught. I went to two years of college and then\n\nMelanie 00:05:01:\n\ndidn't go to college after that. Which they still turned you for. Interestingly love? Um, yeah. Uh, wow. Yeah. And spread this whole different thing. But private school is a racket. I don't know why you do that. Um, yes. So I did that I\n\nMelanie 00:05:20:\n\nand then much later in life, I got into development because it is fun.\n\nMelanie 00:05:26:\n\nUm, I started out like my professional life was in fine art photographic printing. So I had about a decade of, ah, life in the art world there, which makes it sound much sexier than it was. Um, although it was fun and good, like, that was a good time. And then\n\nMelanie 00:05:46:\n\nI had my first daughter and kind of rejected out of the job, seen for a while. And when I came back,\n\nMelanie 00:05:54:\n\nI wanted to do something that, like,\n\nMelanie 00:05:57:\n\ncompensated for my time in a in a decent way, you know, especially living in San Diego. Um, and\n\nMelanie 00:06:07:\n\nI just thought, you know, I had done I have done some little like apple script scripts. Do you know what this thing is? What? Apples with this? Yeah,\n\nMelanie 00:06:17:\n\nyou\n\nJay 00:06:17:\n\nget a few of them. Ah,\n\nJay 00:06:20:\n\nusually ones that turn my mic off because I am notorious for, like, ending a conversation being done and then later on, just being like, Oh, the recording still going And then like having three hours of just dead audio toe toe work on?\n\nMelanie 00:06:36:\n\nYeah, yeah, it's just a little fiddly stuff like that. And so I am. I made some scripts, like, way back\n\nMelanie 00:06:45:\n\nmany, many years ago. I don't know, 15 years ago or something, And, uh\n\nMelanie 00:06:50:\n\nso when I was trying to figure out where am I gonna go now with my career and loves, like, you know, I had fun with that. I'm one,\n\nMelanie 00:06:59:\n\nyou know, making computers do stuff. Like maybe I could do some of that same born, um, and then came, you know, in my learning process came across the python community in San Diego and like\n\nMelanie 00:07:11:\n\nthat was it. That's how I am. Kind of got my heat settled.\n\nMelanie 00:07:17:\n\nSo, um, I work in a rightly or really not the car shop, as we were discussing earlier. Um, although I have repaired my car in a variety of ways on my own.\n\nMelanie 00:07:29:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:07:31:\n\nit still works. It still runs Most of the things we're still on there. It does have a weird rattle. Um, anyway, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:07:39:\n\nand my little side projects five up is still\n\nMelanie 00:07:44:\n\nup and running.\n\nMelanie 00:07:46:\n\nSo\n\nMelanie 00:07:48:\n\nthat's me. I have two kids. I'm cat\n\nMelanie 00:07:51:\n\nE, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:07:53:\n\nBut I think that's it. The end. Is there more? What else should I say?\n\nJay 00:07:58:\n\nNo, that's it. That's good podcast. No, no, we're gonna look, look, goingto a lot of more detail than that, but but yeah, let's let's start with you know, one of the things that you just brought up was\n\nJay 00:08:11:\n\nyou wanted to do a job that you felt you were being compensated for. I guess I would say as fairly as\n\nJay 00:08:22:\n\nweird systems that can\n\nJay 00:08:25:\n\nYeah, we're not gonna go into that conversation. That's another podcast. But, ah, the big thing was, it wasn't, You know, development wasn't something that you were like.\n\nJay 00:08:36:\n\nHey, I'm, like, 14 and hacking in tow. You know, the U S treasury and I've always been a programmer, and like, it wasn't like this whole crazy lifestyle thing for Yeah, I was like,\n\nJay 00:08:50:\n\nHere's a small piece of my life that I do that\n\nJay 00:08:54:\n\nI mean, it be cool if I got paid to do this. I mean, like that. That's a really\n\nJay 00:08:59:\n\ninteresting approach, because it kind of goes against what everybody is taught. You know, when you go to high school, you have to do like, Oh, yeah, you know, you need to go to the best school toe, get into engineering or get into our did to get into all these things. And it's like\n\nJay 00:09:16:\n\nor you could just live your life, do the things that you enjoy doing and then find something in that realm that actually gives you a paycheck and then do that and then in your free time, make really cool stuff like five up, which we're gonna talk about later. Um, so So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool. Did you find a challenge? Ah, like, did you find it challenging to get into the tech space, Not having the I went toe Caltech or m I t. And you know up. You know, I was born with a keyboard in my hand, like that whole mindset.\n\nMelanie 00:09:52:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:09:55:\n\nit's tricky because I feel like not having those types of credentials.\n\nMelanie 00:10:06:\n\nI still like it.\n\nMelanie 00:10:08:\n\nIt affects me like it means more to me than it does to other people. You know, I'm\n\nMelanie 00:10:16:\n\nI'm grateful. I mean, that's from my experience. Like, I'm grateful that I hade, um, the experience of applying to Riley in working through that process and not\n\nMelanie 00:10:31:\n\nnot having the pressure to have some sort of pedigree\n\nMelanie 00:10:36:\n\nin intact.\n\nMelanie 00:10:39:\n\nSo I didn't experience that, But it is always really interesting to talk, Teoh. Other folks that do you have an experience? I was talking to someone the other day who was mentioning that, um, it just so happened that in there, like a p\n\nMelanie 00:10:59:\n\ncomputer science class that they had,\n\nMelanie 00:11:03:\n\nthey're like senior year in high school, which, first of all, ending a farming town.\n\nMelanie 00:11:09:\n\nWe had f A like\n\nMelanie 00:11:12:\n\nalso way.\n\nMelanie 00:11:14:\n\nThe way that my life shook out. I only I graduated early, surly had, like, one semester of my senior year. And then I went and, like, works in a coffee shop after that, you know, like\n\nMelanie 00:11:25:\n\nour situations were like small time, different So but he,\n\nMelanie 00:11:30:\n\nyou know, was saying\n\nMelanie 00:11:33:\n\nin my\n\nMelanie 00:11:34:\n\nin my a p\n\nMelanie 00:11:36:\n\nCS class.\n\nMelanie 00:11:39:\n\nThe teacher happens to know, like the super good friends that someone high up in, you know, X y z tech, like in a huge tech company. And so this BP or whatever from this big tech company comes in and does like, practice interviews with every limits in the class. They're seniors, the high school, they're like 17. You know what I'm saying? Like were 18 or however old they are. They're teenagers, though, for sure. So there's these\n\nMelanie 00:12:07:\n\nteenagers. Some of them then got jobs like straight out of high school.\n\nMelanie 00:12:13:\n\nIt's like I was just kind of like,\n\nMelanie 00:12:17:\n\nwhoa,\n\nMelanie 00:12:19:\n\nyou know, like\n\nMelanie 00:12:20:\n\nand I know that, um,\n\nMelanie 00:12:24:\n\nyou know, you were saying\n\nMelanie 00:12:26:\n\na second ago like we don't want to get into the whole, like, inequality and what's like, you know, fair compensation and stuff.\n\nMelanie 00:12:33:\n\nUm, but it is just kind of\n\nMelanie 00:12:36:\n\nit is kind of mind blowing, right that some people do walk into the tech space saying, you know, I have\n\nMelanie 00:12:44:\n\nI have all these credentials. I have all these this experiments, you know, and I'm like one of the computer stuff, but which I did.\n\nMelanie 00:12:55:\n\nI did have a continuing everyone Yeah, yeah,\n\nMelanie 00:13:01:\n\nI've played Tetris super good at it\n\nJay 00:13:05:\n\nfor me. I always hesitate, you know, toe to talk about kind of the entrance into the tech space, Um, from any level of knowledge, because I technically haven't entered the development space working on it trying really am. But, you know, it is interesting to hear, you know,\n\nJay 00:13:27:\n\nthe conversation of\n\nJay 00:13:30:\n\nyou have a perfect example\n\nJay 00:13:33:\n\ngiving a resume to someone or like this, presenting a resume to a company and, like having two people\n\nJay 00:13:40:\n\nlook at your resume and tell you to conflicting things like one is like, Oh, you need to focus on your projects more because you don't have the job experience and one says, Oh, but your other job experience is super relatable for a higher management position, so you should focus on that more, and it's like, Okay, I have one person telling me to put my job experience at the front. The other one told me to put my projects at the front. I can't put them both there like I need writing something. So it it's always interesting to hear the idea of like\n\nJay 00:14:11:\n\nit can't be this hard\n\nJay 00:14:13:\n\nfor everybody, and it's not necessarily.\n\nJay 00:14:18:\n\nYou know, I don't have a solution for that, but I would just I love hearing people address that, like OK, yeah.\n\nJay 00:14:26:\n\nFor some people, it was extremely easy for others. It was a little bit harder. And then for some, they're still trying to get their foot in the door. Um,\n\nJay 00:14:36:\n\nbut at the end of the day, I'm glad for some of the people who have\n\nJay 00:14:41:\n\ngone through whatever they did,\n\nJay 00:14:44:\n\nbecause now they know what it took, which means they're willing to help other people not have to go through that same thing.\n\nMelanie 00:14:52:\n\nYeah,\n\nMelanie 00:14:53:\n\nAnd I have to say, like, you know, I worked hard. I tried to learn, I went to conferences and, you know, I built my thing, and I did\n\nMelanie 00:15:04:\n\nThose couple of talks like, I put time and energy into it,\n\nMelanie 00:15:11:\n\nbut I knew someone. I honestly think that networking is huge,\n\nMelanie 00:15:19:\n\nwhich is also\n\nMelanie 00:15:23:\n\njust a huge, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:15:27:\n\nplayground for injustice\n\nMelanie 00:15:30:\n\nright\n\nJay 00:15:30:\n\nnow\n\nJay 00:15:32:\n\nbecause not everybody knows. Well, it I guess the hard part is, is like, if you know someone, you could get a foot in the door. But like\n\nJay 00:15:41:\n\nthe people that don't know anyone have a problem And then there's also like\n\nJay 00:15:46:\n\nthe We don't want to punish you for bringing in the wrong people kind of feeling that they come that comes with it. Like I I see so many people of color that air in\n\nJay 00:15:58:\n\nmanagement levels that work with no other people of color. And it's just like,\n\nJay 00:16:05:\n\nI mean, I'm glad you're not like using it as a way to, like, bring just anybody in. But at the same time, it seems really weird that, like there's not one and it and it's because of that. It's like, Well, if I\n\nJay 00:16:20:\n\nWhat if I make a mistake? What if I I have a bad higher and they happen to be a person of color? And then now you're making the problem even worse and even harder for other people in it. It's like again,\n\nJay 00:16:33:\n\nI just wish that it wasn't this hard for everyone and that they didn't have to go to sleep, you know, worrying about their job because they hired someone that they know is capable of doing the work. But because of how they look, you know, it could be a problem. But\n\nJay 00:16:46:\n\nultimately, I don't think that the conversation we're gonna have here is probably gonna solve that problem. But I do hope that someone listening, uh, maybe you can, you know, solve a smaller problem like that and you know your own little world.\n\nJay 00:17:02:\n\nBut you talked about\n\nJay 00:17:05:\n\nyou know, you\n\nJay 00:17:06:\n\nall the things that you did Do you know, aside from knowing someone like you gave the talks, you built the thing. Like when I first met you,\n\nJay 00:17:17:\n\nI was trying to build a thing\n\nJay 00:17:19:\n\nand, like, I had no clue what I was doing. And I think, um, a good like, a couple of mutual friends of ours were just like\n\nJay 00:17:27:\n\nI mean, this is a cool idea. What are you doing\n\nMelanie 00:17:31:\n\non? I mean,\n\nJay 00:17:33:\n\nI I had probably I'd probably been using Python for maybe, like, a week and 1/2. So it was like, I have an exact problem. I've solved it in kind of this really ugly way. Now I want to take it to the next step and solve it in a slightly less ugly way. And in doing that, I just kind of screwed it up. But I'm going to talk about your\n\nJay 00:17:56:\n\nDjango app that just brings joy into the world and phones of people. So I'm just gonna I'm going to just sit back and let you just talk about about the app. Talk about the idea for it. Talk about you know what it's been like running it for as long as you've been running. I can't I can't imagine. Like,\n\nJay 00:18:16:\n\nI don't think I have anything that's been in the wild for, like, more than a year.\n\nMelanie 00:18:22:\n\nYeah. Um, so\n\nMelanie 00:18:25:\n\nfive opap dot com\n\nMelanie 00:18:27:\n\nIt's a Django out.\n\nMelanie 00:18:29:\n\nUm, it is not a phone app. I have to say the whole I was just thinking about this today. I think five up dot com was taken. And so I think that's where I went with five. Look after Tom. But to non tech people, like they're like, what's the thing that I download in the night? Just have to say, I'm sorry I made a thing that's confusing. Just\n\nMelanie 00:18:51:\n\njust ignore that for a second and felt the form and give me all of your personal contact information.\n\nMelanie 00:18:57:\n\nAnd then something good is gonna happen. Trust possibly did. Yeah. I mean, I'm a random person on the Internet. Why not? You know. So, um, yes. So what it does is it sends happy texts every day. That's its only function. That's all it does. I got the idea. It's build it because I actually, um the first, like\n\nMelanie 00:19:23:\n\nclass that I took on python was through Udacity. And they have this bit in there Where you, um you had to make a little bit of a project using Tulio.\n\nMelanie 00:19:39:\n\nUm and so I had done, like, I had kind of come up with this idea of, like, isn't that when that be nice to just get happened? Texts\n\nMelanie 00:19:48:\n\nAnd part of the idea between our for sending five texts, which is what it was initially that you could only get five, and that was it. Like you're gonna have a quantity of five. Happy.\n\nMelanie 00:20:01:\n\nWe're guard lis of what you like. That's what you're getting. Um, but the idea is there's some research that, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:20:11:\n\nmaybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Whatever. Um, but this concept that need 3 to 5 positive things to outweigh each negatives thing that happens to you. So the idea is like, I'm kind of betting on a negative thing, but you every day. But I mean, if you end up with a surplus of happy. It's fine. It's time\n\nMelanie 00:20:36:\n\nnot to be upset about it. So eventually I changed it so that you can choose\n\nMelanie 00:20:42:\n\n1234 or five per day\n\nMelanie 00:20:46:\n\nbecause people were like, it's too happy\n\nMelanie 00:20:48:\n\nsaying they were actually just like is like a really, really happy person around you and your like, you're just annoying. Now. I'm sorry. Like I love the people are friendly and something is working well for you, but if you could do it away from me, that would be wonderful. So, um, video just a little bit of happened. Just one.\n\nMelanie 00:21:07:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:21:08:\n\nyeah, and\n\nMelanie 00:21:11:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:21:12:\n\nSo I came to the python, meet up with this, you know, kind of baby idea. This python script, Um, and then someone was like, oh, built the Django\n\nMelanie 00:21:22:\n\nand I was like,\n\nMelanie 00:21:24:\n\nall right, you know, like,\n\nMelanie 00:21:26:\n\nand then it was just like months of being like I don't know what I'm doing\n\nMelanie 00:21:33:\n\nat all and just going home and, like, suffering through, you know, trying to go through this development process and figure it was going on like\n\nMelanie 00:21:43:\n\nI didn't know it at the time, and I do now. It's kind of both comforting and in theory, ating that, like hours, hours and hours, days, weeks of developers time are spent over, like\n\nMelanie 00:21:57:\n\na semi colon in the wrong place. You know, like\n\nMelanie 00:22:02:\n\njust a single character, you know, or just this, these the tiniest thing. So, you know, I went to months of that and then\n\nMelanie 00:22:12:\n\neventually got it. Somewhat working was very buggy at first. Um, it is still kind of bugging. Actually Had someone report above a couple weeks ago, and I I almost have it. Thanks, but, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:22:27:\n\nyou know, life, but whatever.\n\nJay 00:22:30:\n\nWe need bugs in life, I guess.\n\nMelanie 00:22:33:\n\nYeah. I mean,\n\nMelanie 00:22:36:\n\nno, I got in your gardens\n\nMelanie 00:22:40:\n\nright there. Get in the garden. I always try to do that. Things I have young kids, you know where you're like. Let me spine\n\nMelanie 00:22:46:\n\nfinds him to be grateful for about that, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:22:51:\n\nbugs\n\nMelanie 00:22:52:\n\nreminds us that we're fallible or something. I\n\nJay 00:22:57:\n\nOh, that's that's too funny, though. And I love that, like, again. A lot of the story that came from from this was\n\nJay 00:23:08:\n\na level of like, I understand that that life sucks at times.\n\nJay 00:23:13:\n\nSo\n\nJay 00:23:15:\n\nat best I'm I'm leveling the playing field or I guess it. At worst, I'm leveling the playing field That best I'm giving you, like\n\nJay 00:23:24:\n\nextra happy. Which to me, that is That is like\n\nJay 00:23:30:\n\na lot of people know, like my favorite\n\nJay 00:23:33:\n\npersonality in the entire world is the late, great Bob Ross, and it was just like nobody on the planet should ever be. This happy like the guy, like adopt squirrels. It's,\n\nJay 00:23:48:\n\nI think, of the some of the greatest people that have ever lived. Like Nikola Tesla apparently married a pigeon like there's just a level of coziness that just comes with being\n\nJay 00:24:01:\n\nan amazing person. And I think that if you could be crazily like happy and just want other people to be justice crazily happy as you like that is the best possible outcome because the\n\nJay 00:24:18:\n\nthe worst\n\nMelanie 00:24:18:\n\nside of that is\n\nJay 00:24:19:\n\nlike serial killer. So it's like extremely happy sociopath. Serial killer. Where on the spectrum are you and right? So I love that one that you're using your coding skills for good and not sociopathic serial killer. He stuff,\n\nJay 00:24:35:\n\nYeah, but also that\n\nJay 00:24:39:\n\nyou pushed through because it was just suggested to you. Um, I am like the exact opposite of that someone tells me to build a jangle after like that. I don't want to build a jingle app. I want to build a flask app. I want a village static site generator like I want to do everything but the thing that everyone is telling me to do because they're telling me to do it this way. And I need to know why I shouldn't do it that 8000 other ways.\n\nJay 00:25:03:\n\nBut\n\nJay 00:25:05:\n\non top of that, you were actually willing to\n\nJay 00:25:09:\n\nshare that experience with the community and not just the app itself. But I've I've had the privilege of listening to what I would consider the greatest python conference talk ever. Um, which is like, so you want to build a jingle app? It's like\n\nJay 00:25:25:\n\nyou. You bring your personality into\n\nJay 00:25:30:\n\nall the things that you do like. I'm on the 50 website and it's like how it works. Sometimes life has sad things. We have happy messages,\n\nJay 00:25:38:\n\nthen\n\nMelanie 00:25:38:\n\nyou're not\n\nJay 00:25:39:\n\nso sad anymore. And it's just like\n\nJay 00:25:42:\n\nit doesn't have this weird like s CEO, like marketing spend using 15 different buzzwords for social ranking and like all of this other stuff that people try to do to game the system. It's like\n\nJay 00:25:57:\n\nit is\n\nJay 00:25:58:\n\ntruly a Melanie Appetite, Melanie website and time. I would be afraid to look at the code because I'm sure the comments would just have me laughing. It's like, This is stupid. I'm not gonna dio because that's what my code looks like. It's like, I hate that I have to\n\nMelanie 00:26:15:\n\ndo this\n\nJay 00:26:16:\n\nBut apparently Python hates me. So\n\nMelanie 00:26:20:\n\nusually those air like\n\nMelanie 00:26:22:\n\nI bet my get history\n\nMelanie 00:26:24:\n\nmy get history is where I hide my secret feelings for sure. Like less often. Yeah, exactly less often in the code itself, I think.\n\nMelanie 00:26:35:\n\nBut Gathers I think there's some some fun. Makes sense Is that there Are you looking girl, your eyes\n\nJay 00:26:45:\n\nlooking for a good one? Execute some lint ing c L. I love it. It's just like,\n\nMelanie 00:26:50:\n\nOh, see, that's recent. Yeah, that's me. Just do you want stuff cleaning up?\n\nJay 00:26:56:\n\nYeah, I mean, that's I probably should do deleted, weird static directory. Stuff like this\n\nMelanie 00:27:03:\n\nis I go. This is\n\nJay 00:27:04:\n\nthe stuff that I think developers need to see on a more regular basis because you get these weird posts or, like, how to write ineffective, get commit messages like I mean, yes, sure, I understand. If someone's reviewing your code, you want to make it as helpful when is clear and concise as possible, but at the same time being able to just get your frustration out a little bit and I get commit?\n\nJay 00:27:28:\n\nSure, do it. I think that's absolutely a wonderful way. Teoh, Uh, one not go insane, but to also again inject a little bit of yourself into your work. And, uh, I mean, you've always done that, But please tell everybody about some of the talks you've given about this about well, about the five up app. And also\n\nJay 00:27:53:\n\njust why just just why? Because the, um I can't even I can't even begin Teoh like breakdown like the talks themselves because they're so good.\n\nMelanie 00:28:07:\n\nAh, they really I mean, that's\n\nJay 00:28:09:\n\nthat's not me. Like, you know, trying to butter you up. I genuinely you made me try Django for the first time, literally.\n\nMelanie 00:28:16:\n\nYou're talking\n\nJay 00:28:17:\n\nlike OK, I will use Django, but only because Melanie said it's not as bad as it looks.\n\nMelanie 00:28:24:\n\nIt's not as bad as it looks. Um, yeah, So I\n\nMelanie 00:28:31:\n\nI think I only have the two talks that I ever\n\nMelanie 00:28:35:\n\nlike, actually gays. I gave them both multiple times, though, um, And then I did also do a, um,\n\nMelanie 00:28:44:\n\nlike an injured a python that life on a couple years in a row. Um, that waas, um,\n\nMelanie 00:28:51:\n\nin short, a python for human people with feelings.\n\nMelanie 00:28:55:\n\nUm, which was a lot of fun, I think. Like\n\nMelanie 00:29:00:\n\ngetting in and out on a 25 minute talk is way more manageable for me. Like I think that that's kind of my sweet spot. Three hours of like, having to make sense is pretty tricky.\n\nMelanie 00:29:13:\n\nJust like I'm so sorry. Everyone, you know,\n\nJay 00:29:16:\n\nthree hours long,\n\nMelanie 00:29:18:\n\nred, like in the end, you're just like, I don't know, let's talk about those bugs again or something. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:29:27:\n\nso, yeah, the first talk that I wrote waas about my experience writing five up and like\n\nMelanie 00:29:34:\n\nall of the things that I did long because some of them were kind of like\n\nMelanie 00:29:39:\n\na little bit tragic, you know, like I mean,\n\nMelanie 00:29:43:\n\nlike, recoverable, like I figured it out. But like,\n\nMelanie 00:29:46:\n\nyou know, my email and password were like, committed. And to get at some point\n\nMelanie 00:29:52:\n\nlike that, I agree\n\nMelanie 00:29:54:\n\nthat it's not the best.\n\nMelanie 00:29:56:\n\nUm And then just like accidentally destroying stuff, it's all these stuff. I mean, I don't know that everyone, like,\n\nMelanie 00:30:04:\n\nputs their email and password in their code. Like I feel like I kind of win on that one for, like, dumb stuff that you do on accident. Like I'm pretty\n\nJay 00:30:15:\n\nsure people have done Aziz Muchas They would admit they'd be like, No, I've never done that. I mean,\n\nJay 00:30:21:\n\nMiguel Road, like McGill did a talk about that. I think it pike on a couple of years ago. That's like you accidentally committed your password. Now what do you dio? And to me, that was great because it was saying like, OK,\n\nJay 00:30:35:\n\nprobably one of the most like prominent people to use the plastic framework is telling me that he has screwed up by putting, you know, some type of environment variable that shouldn't be in there or some type of password or some type of authentic r A p I key. That should not have been hard coded in there like he has done this. So when I mean after that talk, I was like, OK, I am team environment, variable for life like\n\nJay 00:31:02:\n\nthe first thing you see is like import os every time because I'm like I will not do that again. I've had that happen to me where someone's like,\n\nJay 00:31:11:\n\nYeah, heads up, You should Ah, like I submitted a PR that removed your password for you and I'm like, Oh, thank you for that.\n\nMelanie 00:31:19:\n\nCool, Great. That's hopeful.\n\nMelanie 00:31:23:\n\nYeah, exactly. So And I think\n\nMelanie 00:31:28:\n\nI don't know. I think it's important for people to know like\n\nMelanie 00:31:32:\n\nthere's there's no magic going on here. I mean, people do harder stuff than what Ideo like. I understand that, um, and that people are hearing like super fans and stuff. Andi. But\n\nMelanie 00:31:47:\n\nlike I'm fancy enough to be employed. So that's something you know and like\n\nMelanie 00:31:53:\n\nand it's not amazing it I mean, like, it's not. It's not so magical and difficult that you can't do it. You know that you can't like you can become a developer and also be a little bit of a bumbling weirdo like these things can be for you. You could be that in one thing. So like, and I I I feel like our fear of\n\nMelanie 00:32:19:\n\nwow\n\nMelanie 00:32:20:\n\nmaking mistakes\n\nMelanie 00:32:22:\n\nand like\n\nMelanie 00:32:24:\n\nbeing stealing hard,\n\nMelanie 00:32:26:\n\nkeeps us out of spaces where we could really fries. You know, um, and I always imagine that there's someone in the room that is sitting there being like,\n\nMelanie 00:32:37:\n\nWell, I could never you know, because that's me, like, 48\n\nMelanie 00:32:43:\n\n100% of the time I was gonna go 48%. But that's a lie. And 4800. It's not really a value that makes any sense, since, though,\n\nMelanie 00:32:52:\n\nand I have a job, everybody\n\nJay 00:32:54:\n\nand and the thing with that, like\n\nJay 00:32:59:\n\nI I grew up around\n\nJay 00:33:01:\n\nlike the biggest nerd in the world like my grandfather wanted me to be into computers like he let me take apart his computer. He made me put it back together. Um, like I grew up playing with the max, which is probably why I don't use the Mac's in Al.\n\nJay 00:33:19:\n\nLike I thought one of the first computer games was Eclipse, which is ah, like a job I d\n\nMelanie 00:33:28:\n\non. He was\n\nJay 00:33:29:\n\njust like, yeah, I just draw stuff in the things and I was like, OK, cool. I'm gonna make a computer game and, like No, no, I didn't. But he knew that I wasn't going to, but he was like Yeah, sure. Try it anyway. And like, this\n\nMelanie 00:33:40:\n\nis the kind of\n\nJay 00:33:41:\n\nguy that he went to the university library to doubt, like rent out algebra books for fun. And I'm just like your old man. You're supposed to be, like, watching like, daytime news and sleeping on the couch or something. And I always thought that that's what it meant to be like in the tech space of lying. So you gotta get a like\n\nJay 00:34:06:\n\nif you haven't read every Manning book that's out there, you have it. If you don't have, like, the subscription toe like O'Reilly learning, then you're doing it wrong. You need toe. You need to, like,\n\nJay 00:34:17:\n\nhave submitted, like at least three talks toe every major conference using your language. You need to have been to every talk. Like I hear about all the people that love and fawn over WWDC, and they're like, Oh, it's like\n\nJay 00:34:33:\n\nthe mecca for IOS developers is like, Oh, it's like the mecca for conference viruses. So you probably shouldn't like\n\nJay 00:34:42:\n\nput that stigma on people. Not everyone wants to go to a conference. Everyone is can understand half of what you know,\n\nJay 00:34:52:\n\nsomeone who has a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering and has turned that into, like writing functional algorithms using Haskell like not everyone can do.\n\nMelanie 00:35:05:\n\nNot everyone can understand that. And if\n\nJay 00:35:07:\n\nyou don't, it's okay. Like\n\nMelanie 00:35:09:\n\nI think\n\nJay 00:35:10:\n\nPython, because it's readable, literally showed\n\nJay 00:35:13:\n\n100 lines of python code that I had written Teoh, a graphic designer, and they were like,\n\nJay 00:35:19:\n\nI think you miss. I think there's a space after this comma that's not supposed to be there. And I was like,\n\nMelanie 00:35:24:\n\nHow are you debugging my\n\nMelanie 00:35:29:\n\nlike that to\n\nJay 00:35:30:\n\nme is amazing that people can look at the code, read it and understand what's happening, and that it eliminates the stigma of like you have to have void and no parameters instead of code and and it immediately closes the door on people who are just like, Yeah, I just wanna send five happy tweets. You know, our five happy text to my phone like, Can I do that?\n\nMelanie 00:35:53:\n\nNo. One?\n\nMelanie 00:35:55:\n\nNo, I I love Python. For that reason, I do think like it's one of the more low entry languages out there.\n\nMelanie 00:36:05:\n\nI've been working with Java script a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and I want to love all languages equally.\n\nMelanie 00:36:19:\n\nI want that so bad.\n\nMelanie 00:36:21:\n\nAlso Pythons the best. I don't know. I don't. I'm sorry, everyone. I just\n\nMelanie 00:36:28:\n\nIt's just clean ends.\n\nMelanie 00:36:32:\n\nI don't know. It's it's low entry. I think, Um,\n\nMelanie 00:36:37:\n\nyeah, it's good stuff, but what you were saying, um,\n\nMelanie 00:36:42:\n\na second ago about\n\nMelanie 00:36:44:\n\nthis huge range of like one\n\nMelanie 00:36:48:\n\nyou know, one engineer has a PhD in is doing this grace and stuff, you know, down to like, here's me,\n\nMelanie 00:36:56:\n\nyou know, making my little Web app. That doesn't silly and nice thing.\n\nMelanie 00:37:01:\n\nUm, that\n\nMelanie 00:37:03:\n\nthat gap\n\nMelanie 00:37:06:\n\nwas really difficult and overwhelming to experience at my first pie con, Um, because it's, you know what, like 3500 people or something. And you do have these people that have their doctorates and, you know, like listening to some of the talks. I remember because I was, you know, obviously much newer to Python at the time. Um, but I remember just being like I'm not doing,\n\nMelanie 00:37:35:\n\nyou know, like we'd go into a room and there's like, Here's a 20 minute talk\n\nMelanie 00:37:40:\n\nand, like I know they said words and there were slides like there were visuals, so a lot of stuff happening there. And yet\n\nMelanie 00:37:48:\n\nI have no idea what just happened.\n\nMelanie 00:37:52:\n\nSo\n\nMelanie 00:37:54:\n\nno, you know, And then\n\nMelanie 00:37:57:\n\nthe,\n\nMelanie 00:37:58:\n\nyou know, kind of the little circles of people that\n\nMelanie 00:38:02:\n\nthen joined up in our like, you know, what do you dio And\n\nMelanie 00:38:06:\n\nyou know, like, I do fancy things, You know? I'm like\n\nMelanie 00:38:11:\n\nHyson tweets the tell you your sparkling mermaid, not tweets and text messages, You know, actual message by the way you mentioned earlier. Bob Ross. Do you know that? I quote Bob Breast in private.\n\nJay 00:38:24:\n\nI didn't. And now\n\nJay 00:38:27:\n\nI I don't get text messages. City\n\nJay 00:38:31:\n\nI mean,\n\nMelanie 00:38:31:\n\nI probably drug simple.\n\nJay 00:38:32:\n\nNo, it's not you. It's I go, Yeah, I did this thing where it was like, don't ever get a message or like, a phone call from anyone that's on your favorites. And ever since then, people like chaos and your message lychee After you did\n\nJay 00:38:49:\n\ne don't get half my messages anymore, which is great, cause I have plausible deniability. Anytime I don't want to do something like I didn't get the message. I'm sorry.\n\nMelanie 00:38:56:\n\nYeah, I think that's awesome.\n\nMelanie 00:38:59:\n\nI mean, you broke up with me, and I just found out\n\nMelanie 00:39:03:\n\nand we literally had a like It's not years me moments that happened\n\nMelanie 00:39:10:\n\nthat's gonna be on the Internet now is fine. Oh, man.\n\nMelanie 00:39:14:\n\nScience. My received text that I send myself. That's what I going to dio like self wish that I do. Now\n\nJay 00:39:23:\n\nI'm gonna do the horrible thing you should never do after a breakup. I'm just gonna keep going forward.\n\nJay 00:39:28:\n\nThank\n\nJay 00:39:32:\n\nyou. Talked about, like, just kind of the vast difference of conversations that air had it conferences.\n\nJay 00:39:42:\n\nI gave my first conference talk at North Bay Python last year and, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:39:50:\n\nI couldn't go. So a conference, it\n\nJay 00:39:53:\n\nreally isn't there not having won this year, which I mean,\n\nJay 00:39:57:\n\nAnd\n\nJay 00:39:58:\n\nthey announced it last year that they were having won. I felt like I felt like they\n\nMelanie 00:40:02:\n\nfeel like\n\nJay 00:40:02:\n\nJosh knew he was just like, something's gonna happen. He's like, we don't want to be a part of it. We're out this year will see on two years. But\n\nJay 00:40:12:\n\none of the talks, that was it was like the second I was the last talk in the first half. And then the next talk after me was Greedo. And he was talking about writing. He was\n\nMelanie 00:40:25:\n\ntalking about writing\n\nJay 00:40:25:\n\na peg par surfer python. And I'm just like\n\nMelanie 00:40:29:\n\nI don't know what\n\nJay 00:40:30:\n\nyou're talking about. I'm gonna look, and I'm just gonna be like, Okay, Yeah, sure, whatever. And then we all got dinner together and it was me,\n\nJay 00:40:41:\n\nyou know, And then, like a couple of other developers that are like python core maintainers and I'm just like\n\nJay 00:40:48:\n\nand luckily, my talk was mostly about podcasting, So I felt like I knew what I was talking about, but they were all like, Ah, yes. So I would really love to learn how like podcasting could be implemented, you know, in a larger\n\nJay 00:41:04:\n\naudience in the python community. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I would love to learn more about whatever it is you talked about earlier to Andi. That's like, That's the crazy feeling that when we create this facade that, like, you have to have a PhD, you have to be, you know,\n\nJay 00:41:23:\n\na huge brainiac to write code that matters. What you're doing is you're taking your skill set away from the people that could genuinely benefit from the things that you can bring to the table like has a podcaster I know way more than any human should about dealing with transcriptions with AWS and\n\nJay 00:41:47:\n\nhaving these talks with mentors where it's like,\n\nJay 00:41:51:\n\nHey, I built a framework that does like it creates a\n\nJay 00:41:55:\n\nstandard schema for transcription. So matter what Web service you're using, whatever developable law. And they're just like,\n\nJay 00:42:02:\n\nwhy? I was like because you told me I needed a project that would make me hire Well, that's why. And they're like But why that when I was like, Well, it's because it's a thing that I have to deal with on a regular basis. So and as we're breaking it down and like talking about it, they're just like,\n\nJay 00:42:18:\n\nWait,\n\nJay 00:42:20:\n\nwhat you built this I'm like, Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but like, you know, this is like, this is stuff that you would give, like a keynote talk on, like the whole process of building this stuff. And it's like I just had a problem that I need to solve. So I solved it. And then I realized that there was a bigger problem, so I started working on solving that, too, and they're like, Yeah, that's what developers do. Congratulations and I'm like, Well, okay, I still need a job\n\nJay 00:42:50:\n\nlike no one's gonna take me serious If I'm just the guy that comes up and goes, Hey, I do podcasting. Come on, let's talk about Python. Um, it and that's where it's It's so frustrating because it's like, How do we fix that? And I've literally had people telling me like\n\nJay 00:43:06:\n\nyou would give really good talks it, like the local conference seen and I'm like, What the hell does that mean? And they're like, Well, you know, some talks were made for conferences that have less than, like 1000 people and then some. Some talks were made for people that are not for people, but for conferences that have, like there, like Pike on Level. And I'm like, Okay, that's stupid. Like I feel like my should be good\n\nMelanie 00:43:30:\n\none of\n\nJay 00:43:30:\n\nthe people\n\nMelanie 00:43:33:\n\nthat\n\nMelanie 00:43:35:\n\nthat's frustrating. That's a frustrating thing that you just described that someone said, like also, I'm gonna go and say That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Like\n\nMelanie 00:43:46:\n\nso. And\n\nMelanie 00:43:50:\n\nbecause a at Piper on not every\n\nMelanie 00:43:55:\n\ntalk is Aquino.\n\nMelanie 00:43:58:\n\nJust just in case anyone hasn't been before, there's either. There's a handful of key notes, but when you pulled off. All the majority of the stocks are in a small room, you know. So\n\nMelanie 00:44:11:\n\ntalk it, Pike. On talking a local conference like you could end up with the same number of people like ends. You know, Northway Python. It's single track. So instead of you know, at high Con, where you have seven different walks, you could go to it and given time slot,\n\nMelanie 00:44:27:\n\nyou know, Northway Python. There's one you're gonna end up with it a pack grim.\n\nJay 00:44:32:\n\nEverybody at that conference paid to hear you talk.\n\nMelanie 00:44:35:\n\nYeah, exactly. It's wonderful. So there's that element. But also\n\nMelanie 00:44:43:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:44:44:\n\nI feel like\n\nMelanie 00:44:49:\n\nyou never know why\n\nMelanie 00:44:51:\n\nyour talk gets turned away from any particular conference. You know, it could be that they got\n\nMelanie 00:44:58:\n\na bunch of different talks on that same topic. Like it just so happens to be that way, you know? I mean, unless is it are you doing close like sleight of hand magic? Is that because I can see I can say that being like meeting a small room\n\nJay 00:45:15:\n\nfor this\n\nMelanie 00:45:15:\n\npresentation, a volunteer\n\nMelanie 00:45:19:\n\nand need a volunteer, and everyone has to be within arm's length of my body\n\nMelanie 00:45:24:\n\nso and I don't know. I mean,\n\nMelanie 00:45:29:\n\nI think in general, in life,\n\nMelanie 00:45:32:\n\nnone of us know we're doing like, ever. So when people sit down and they're like, Well, this thing is good for this circumstance, Like, you know, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:45:43:\n\nnone of us know what we're doing. Just admit it and go on, like with any of the stuff we're doing. We're lucky that we still exist as a species.\n\nJay 00:45:57:\n\nAbsolutely. And I want in this on a way more positive. Note that wherever you are now, So please tell me what's what's next for five up. Is there anything next for five up? Is it just gonna be more of the same? And I'm okay with that, too, cause I'm happy with it.\n\nMelanie 00:46:15:\n\nUm well, first is fixing the very important broken thing.\n\nMelanie 00:46:22:\n\nThis so that that's sexy updates coming at you fast. Um, but there are There are some things that I've wanted to dio um,\n\nMelanie 00:46:32:\n\nSo there's a database that I curate of messages that go out, but you've been also every user has a personal needs, so I can send you my link, and you can put a nice message into my cue and I'll get that mixed in with the other curated ones. Um, and that's like actually a really, really fun and powerful\n\nMelanie 00:46:52:\n\num, feature. What I want to do with that is make it so that you can see your past messages like your past custom ones and break you them, because right now you get it once and you never see it again. So I don't want to reveal them before you get thm. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:47:12:\n\nbecause the surprise is important.\n\nMelanie 00:47:14:\n\nWe like surprised, like delight is in surprise. Unless it's like\n\nMelanie 00:47:20:\n\nsurprise your bankrupt like That's not awesome. But like surprise. I think you're a cool person. Is like is nice, you know, So I don't want to reveal them before you see them, But it's\n\nMelanie 00:47:31:\n\nsome of the custom messages that I've received, and I know that other people have received have been really\n\nMelanie 00:47:41:\n\nlike they can hold you up, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:47:44:\n\num and so if you have the option to go back and say, like, actually, just keep that in my queue all the time, you know some that's me, every\n\nMelanie 00:47:51:\n\nHoward along. That's that's one thing that I've been wanting to dio, um, I want to make it some people can suggest\n\nMelanie 00:47:59:\n\nthings for the general database. And then I can\n\nMelanie 00:48:02:\n\nsay that\n\nMelanie 00:48:03:\n\nyou know, I can allow them to go in because the it's like\n\nMelanie 00:48:08:\n\n350 messages or so that are in there. But they're all ones that I've stood in. You know that I signed and thinker interesting have been there but would be nice to have other people. You know, we have a lot of men, but then it's You do have lots and Jay Peak America's like,\n\nMelanie 00:48:24:\n\nYeah, some people have weird,\n\nMelanie 00:48:27:\n\nweird heroes out there. This is So, um\n\nMelanie 00:48:32:\n\nyou think those air\n\nMelanie 00:48:35:\n\nI I have been wanting to, like, make it a tweet pot or so, but that's like latter. Now I would love to be able to send pictures. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:48:45:\n\nbut that's kind of it's all kind of tricky because it's this weird like, um,\n\nMelanie 00:48:51:\n\nsent through like it sent by email to the SMTP gateway for each of the carriers, you know, for a long period. So there's a little bit of tricking us involved there.\n\nJay 00:49:04:\n\nYou mentioned using Tulio earlier, and we're definitely not gonna get too deep into the weeds here, But the\n\nJay 00:49:12:\n\nTulio a p I has that like SMS thing?\n\nJay 00:49:18:\n\nIs that utilizing the same like email stuff? Or is that actually using, like a phone number type\n\nJay 00:49:25:\n\nwhatever.\n\nMelanie 00:49:29:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:49:30:\n\nabandoned twilio straightaway because it's very expensive. Um, especially if you get any number of users that are getting five messages a day legs\n\nMelanie 00:49:43:\n\nI can't afford that is quite expensive. And so but send bread,\n\nMelanie 00:49:48:\n\num, was very affordable. And so I had to kind of do this hack around to figure out how to use the S and P gateways to send The message is so like each carrier has like, a phone number at\n\nMelanie 00:50:01:\n\nsomething at 18 c commune over something like this. So you email the\n\nMelanie 00:50:07:\n\nthat email address, then it comes through a text.\n\nMelanie 00:50:11:\n\nSo that's what I did. And then, interestingly enough, uh, Tulio then acquired sin bread and ensure\n\nMelanie 00:50:19:\n\nthey have not jacked up saying grits, Princes, is this I know. Or maybe I've like, you know, I just got in at the right time, But, um, when I saw that, I was like, Please don't touch me more money. I do this for fun.\n\nMelanie 00:50:33:\n\nI want people to be happy. But like, not like many, many hundreds of dollars are happy.\n\nJay 00:50:39:\n\nAll of my users air happy. I am miserable because I got a 48th of happy.\n\nMelanie 00:50:44:\n\nYeah, I can do that. I can't do that.\n\nMelanie 00:50:47:\n\nSo,\n\nMelanie 00:50:49:\n\nyeah, that's how that works.\n\nJay 00:50:50:\n\nAnd five up is free, right?\n\nMelanie 00:50:53:\n\nYeah.\n\nMelanie 00:50:53:\n\nOne of his act. Yeah.\n\nJay 00:50:57:\n\nUh, though message and data rates may apply. I just saw that at the bottom.\n\nMelanie 00:51:02:\n\nYeah, I did that stuff that\n\nMelanie 00:51:06:\n\ndoesn't say like expensive messages are not happy. I'm pretty sure I shove blood in there.\n\nJay 00:51:11:\n\nAh,\n\nJay 00:51:12:\n\nLissy.\n\nJay 00:51:13:\n\nYes? Make sure you know about your texting and data plan. Expensive messages are not happy.\n\nMelanie 00:51:19:\n\nThey're not. I mean, I have a good database of messages, but, like, I don't know if they cost you 1/4. No, e, I don't know. I don't know about that.\n\nJay 00:51:29:\n\nOh, man, that's too good. All right, well, let's let's get ready to button this up, cause we seven after show to get Teoh. Um, let everybody know once again, if they want to talk to you or if they want to learn more about five up, um, Or if they wanna check out any of your amazing conference talks, where can they do all of those things.\n\nMelanie 00:51:52:\n\nLet's see. So five up is five a pap dot com.\n\nMelanie 00:51:58:\n\nUm, I am on Twitter and, like, everywhere on the Internet almost is. Hello, Melanie C. Um, so twitters where I hang out the most, um, Facebook and I are on a break.\n\nMelanie 00:52:11:\n\nEso don't look for me there. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:52:15:\n\nsee what else?\n\nMelanie 00:52:18:\n\nFive apps on Twitter. I think it's high by Bob the terrible\n\nMelanie 00:52:22:\n\nproject, Mom,\n\nMelanie 00:52:24:\n\nit's on there somewhere. You'll find it just 11.\n\nJay 00:52:27:\n\nSome branding thing will figure that out.\n\nMelanie 00:52:29:\n\nYeah, and then all of my talk, sir, on YouTube. So\n\nMelanie 00:52:35:\n\nif you want, you can keep them all up and compare each, you know, performance to the next and rate them and send it to me. And I'll get real sad about it. Never beautiful.\n\nJay 00:52:47:\n\nI would recommend the ah, the North Bay Python talk.\n\nJay 00:52:51:\n\nUm, about how to get started. To Jingo, it was very, very funny. I heard multiple people, not just me say that it was the best talk of the entire conference, so Oh, yeah. You could definitely got that award.\n\nJay 00:53:07:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:53:08:\n\nyeah,\n\nMelanie 00:53:09:\n\nit was It was a fun one. It was fun. Everything went wrong. Little preview furry you people out there the panic that you see Israel. It was not staged.\n\nJay 00:53:19:\n\nOh, I remember that. It was Yeah, that was\n\nJay 00:53:24:\n\nI think I triple prepared for my talk. Because of that, I was just like, I know it works. I know everything is good. I'm just going to do it again just to make sure. And also that was their first year doing a conference. So I'm sure, like,\n\nJay 00:53:40:\n\nthe first year versus the third year, though, should they got a lot of bugs? You know, it\n\nMelanie 00:53:45:\n\nwasn't them. It wasn't them. It was me. And I swear to you, I had practiced that talk so many times. And the things that went wrong that you saw had never gone wrong before. Like had not gone run 30 minutes prior. When that happens, been in the green room.

Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.\n\nI don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and\nbecome equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.\nInstead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust\npunishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never\nable to gain any amount of legitimate growth.\n\nForce the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that\nare disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest\nperson of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the\nonly one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.\n\nIf you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely\n(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for\nyou.\n\n## On Rioting\n\nIn my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.\nFurthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me\nfrom my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked\nto be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and\nthe fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint\nand had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took\nthem from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the\nage of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop\ncar over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.\n\nMeanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,\nuneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you\nhave pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local\ncommunities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation\nof Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict\ngovernment oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.\n\nIt took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is\nfounded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we\nmurdered until we got it.\n\nWe did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to\nourselves (see civil war).\n\nNow when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our\nnation call us Terrorists.\n\nWhile I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and\nmaintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying\nthe example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those\nthat murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while\nthe rest of society looked away.\n\n## On The Legal System\n\nIn regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who\nhave the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout\nmy wishes:\n\n* A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down\n* More racial and gender diversity in police forces\n* Mandatory implicit bias checks and training\n* Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making\n  an arrest.\n* The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws\n\nThese ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how\nthey can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that\ncan't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up\nfor themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly.

Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. \n\nI've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.\n\nThis Month, I purchased [DevonThink](https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink). I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other [DevonTechnologies](https://devontechnologies.com) Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future.

This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. \n\n## Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.\n\nI've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. \n\n100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis **or** they were recommended by the aforementioned person.\n\nWhile I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.\n\nI know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. \n\n## Ways to do this\n### 1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.\n\n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg)\n<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small>\n\nOne of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. \n\nEach of them have their own reach and their own network. \nI've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. \n\nI've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. \n\n### 2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method\nSome relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the [Noguchi Filing Method](https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/). \n\nThe Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. \n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg)\n\nI do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. \n\n### 3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)\nI got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.\n\n> I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)\n\n> Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and \"unicorn\" services.\n\n> I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. \n\n> Here is a list of the services I provide.\n\n> My skills include:\n> - social media\n> - recording videos and screencasts\n> - podcast editing and recording\n> - community management\n> - newsletter publishing\n\n> Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?\n \n> Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.\n \nEveryone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. \n\nI didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.\n\nOne person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.\n\nThe other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. \n\n================\n\nNone of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this _grimy_ feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your \"inner-circle\" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.", "title": "Friends have been my Greatest Asset!", "date": "2019-04-17T09:24:00-07:00", "category": "Marketing", "tags": "['networking', 'lead-capture']", "slug": "friends_have_been_my_greatest_asset", "url": "/friends_have_been_my_greatest_asset", "date_published": "Wed, 17 Apr 2019 09:24:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Apr 17, 2019 09:24 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"_content": "A new phenominon in the developer space is now the \ud83c\udf1f_secret_\ud83c\udf1f README.md\ntrick.

This is a look at the first steps of me automating my Github Profile.\n\n## Step 1: Rename the repo my website to a repo named after my GitHub username\n\nThis is easy enough. Just rename the repo (in Github) to your username.\nRemember this has to be exact and it is case-sensitive.\n\nYou can do this in the settings menu of your repo. You don't have to change the\ndirectory names or anything like that on a local machine. (I'm not sure if you\nare using a Git Client other than the cli).\n\n## Step 2: Create a copy of your existing readme as a template\n\nMy goal was to create my README using a Jinja2 and Github Actions. For that I\nwould need a template to render. So since most of the data was the same I just\ncopied my existing README.\n\n## Step 3: Add Dynamic Content using Jinja2 Variables\n\n\nStarting out I wanted to show my latest blog post and my latest podcast episode\nfrom [Productivity in Tech Podcast]. We will create a python script that does\nthis, but we needed to add the variables that Jinja2 would use for the dynamic\ndata.\n\nYou could do something like a search and replace, but I feel like just\nrendering a template is much easier to edit and understand. Also, the compute\ntime for Github Actions is free and this doesn't need to be the most\nperformance conscious program. Also I like Jinja2, so there is also that \ud83d\ude43.\n\n```\n\n# From README_template.md\n\nYou can see what he's posting about at <https://kjaymiller.com>.\n\n**Latest Post - [{{latest_post.title}}]({{latest_post.link}})**\n\n**Latest Productivity in Tech Podcast Episode - [{{latest_podcast_post.title}}]({{latest_podcast_post.link}})**\n\n## Active Projects\n\n```\n\n## Step 4: Build your script to get the data and write the up to date README.md\n\nThis script is pretty simple once you know what you're looking for. I'm using\nthe feedparser plugin to parse the rss feeds and then returning the title and\nlink for the latest episode.\n\n```\ndef get_latest_post(rss_feed):\n    f = feedparser.parse(rss_feed)\n    latest_post = sorted(f['entries'], key=lambda x:x['published_parsed'])[-1]\n    return {\n            'title': latest_post['title'],\n            'link': latest_post['link'],\n            }\n```\n\nThen you set the template to the text of your template file.\n then write the rendered text to your README.\n\n```\n# update readme\ntemplate = Template(Path('./README_template.md').read_text())\nPath('./README.md').write_text(\n        template.render(\n            latest_post=get_latest_post(rss_feed),\n            latest_podcast_post=get_latest_post(podcast_url),\n            )\n        )\n```\n\n## Step 5 Setup your Github Actions File\n\nI'm not the best at Github Actions. Luckily for me, this action was super\nsimple to setup. \n\nYou can look at the [.yml file] I'm not going to talk about the setup of this\nbecause most of it is prep stuff. Here's the important bit.\n\n```\n# in steps:\n- name: Install Feedparser & Jinja2\n  run: pip install feedparser jinja2\n\n- name: Update Readme\n  run: python ./.github/actions/update_readme.py\n\n```\n\nBasically it's installing the things I need and then running the script (I\nsaved the script in that folder, but you don't really have to as long as its in\nyour repo).\n\nAfter that, you add some commands to update your repo and you're off to the\nraces.\n\nI have mine setup to update on a github push in that repo, but in the future I\nwill probably setup the file on a schedule to also update when I push something\nnew (Future Post...Probably).\n\n[Productivity in Tech Podcast]: https://podcast.productivityintech.com", "title": "How I AutoUpdate My Github README using GitHub Actions in 5 Easy Steps", "date": "2020-07-10T15:16:00-07:00", "category": "coding", "tags": "['github', 'github actions', 'python', 'automation']", "slug": "how_i_autoupdate_my_github_readme_using_github_actions_in_5_easy_steps", "url": "/how_i_autoupdate_my_github_readme_using_github_actions_in_5_easy_steps", "date_published": "Fri, 10 Jul 2020 15:16:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Jul 10, 2020 15:16 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"_content": "The following is an excerpt from a personal conversation I had.\n\nNot to be the Subject matter black guy or anything but a couple of years of research and several years of living has taught me this:\n\n1. Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.\n2. There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.\n3. We can't blame \"fathers not being in the homes\". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.\n4. White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.\n\nThat's it.\n\nMy thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these \"Dangerous\" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years\n\n### How Do You Fix Number 2?\n\nMake education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.\n\nAs someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space.

Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.\n\nI can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. \n\n![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/5ArJanyCfxgiY/giphy.gif)", "title": "My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done", "date": "2019-03-25T10:42:00-07:00", "slug": "anxiety-based-gtd", "category": "mental-health", "tags": "['anxiety', 'depression']", "url": "/anxiety-based-gtd", "date_published": "Mon, 25 Mar 2019 10:42:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Mar 25, 2019 10:42 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"_content": "<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https://share.transistor.fm/e/2d916493\"></iframe>\n\n\n## Shownotes\n\nThis is an important PIT Reflection. In it I do share a little productivity, but more importantly, I talk about some code decisions and ultimately what the future looks like for this podcast.\n\n\n### Links\n\n* [DEVONthink - DevonTechnologies](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink)\n* [Miro](https://miro.com)\n* [Nested Folders](https://nestedfolderspodcast.com)\n* [Company of One](https://amzn.to/30zxAE6) (Affiliate Link)\n* [Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog)\n* [Transcriptor - PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor)\n* [Render-Engine - PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/render-engine)\n\n## Transcription\n\n00:00:18:\n\nWhat's up, everybody?\n\n00:00:19:\n\nJay Miller here back with a solo PIT Reflection type thing for the first half of June 2020. this year has sucked royally.\n\n00:00:32:\n\nI don't even want to get into this. Um, all of the individual things that have happened in 2020 have just been nightmarish at best.\n\n00:00:46:\n\nSo this is going to be more of a productivity's side thought exercise for me, and I hope that it will engage your mind a little bit as we sit down and talk.\n\nThat said, it is gonna be a little bit off the head. I have some notes and I'll use those notes. But ultimately, I'm just using them to riff off of.\n\n00:01:13:\n\nSo let's start with a couple of things. First of all, productivity's in general. What am I doing, Productivity wise?\n\nUm, if you would have asked me this question yesterday, I would have told you something different. I am jumping back to the notebook. I go to the notebook like probably once a year. I'm gonna try to do a full year.\n\n00:01:38:\n\nDon't at me. Don't challenge me. Don't do any of those things the way that I see it productivity tools, productivity, apps, productivity. All of those things should be used for you to do your best work. None of these tools should be considered a Bible or any type of gospel for you to breach or proselytize on others.\n\n00:02:06:\n\nIn fact, I'm not using this podcast to preach or proselytize my own productivity method. I am merely telling people how I am doing a thing in hopes that if someone else that is doing something similar here, is it that I might be able to inspire them to try something that works for them or for them to reach out to me and let me know of something that did work for them without any obligation to join the Church of Notion or Rome research or obsidian or all these other apps that said, Let's jump into this.\n\n00:02:51:\n\nWhat absolute using. Like I said, up until today, when I said, You know what, we need to get back on our analog light, our BuJo-esque system.\n\n00:03:03:\n\nI would have said I was using OmniFocus. Um, I think for right now I I don't really have too much stuff in OmniFocus. That will make it hard to transition.\n\n00:03:19:\n\nI wasn't really using OmniFocus as the power tool that most people use it as, um, it was simply a way for me to differ things so that I didn't have to look at him.\n\nGood thing is a notebook and a piece of paper kind of does the same thing. I just don't need to look at it now.\n\n00:03:39:\n\nOne of the biggest apps that I have jumped on. Probably the biggest change in my workflow since leaving Evernote back in 2000 and what, 10? Yeah, I think 2010 was when I left Evernote or not.\n\n00:03:57:\n\nDidn't leave it like the company I stopped using.\n\n00:03:59:\n\nThe application is the adoption of DEVONthink now, DEVONthink, is one of these tools that I think that a lot of people are intimidated by one.\n\n00:04:13:\n\nIt's an expensive tool.\n\n00:04:15:\n\nI get that. Yeah, it's expensive.\n\n00:04:17:\n\nOh, boy, A suspensive.\n\nIt's like fountain pen money expensive.\n\n00:04:23:\n\nThe thing I like about DEVONthink is I don't have to question where I put a thing.\n\n00:04:31:\n\nI deal with a lot of files between the day job, the side business and the other ambitions and inspirations that I have.\n\n00:04:42:\n\nSo for me, it is important that when I'm looking for a thing, I can find it with relative ease.\n\n00:04:51:\n\nDEVONthink allows me to do that.\n\n00:04:54:\n\nIt does its job really well.\n\n00:04:58:\n\nAnd the thing that makes it different from, you know, another power tool that I use Drafts or Evernote or again, like a Notion or Rome Research kind of tool is that one.\n\n00:05:15:\n\nIt beats all the cloud tools because it's designed to work with my local machine.\n\n00:05:21:\n\nSo adding some order to my chaotic system.\n\n00:05:26:\n\nThe other thing that it does is it make some connections and allows me to easily connect things that should be connected.\n\n00:05:39:\n\nAnd it allows me to look at different things from many different schools of thought, which isn't always the best way to do things.\n\n00:05:54:\n\nBut when you need to, it is amazing.\n\n00:06:01:\n\nSo again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this.\n\n00:06:03:\n\nIf you've been looking at DEVONthink you'd know all the stuff that I could talk about with it?\n\n00:06:09:\n\nUm, if you aren't looking into DEVONthink unless you just genuinely have a problem with maintaining lots and lots of files and documents and things like that over a long period of time.\n\n00:06:22:\n\nOr you're just fed up with Evernote as a whole and its inability to, um, not move like a giant green elephant in a china shop, you know, then I mean, give it a try.\n\n00:06:37:\n\nThere's a free trial.\n\n00:06:38:\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n00:06:39:\n\nI mean, if you really want to talk about it, they have a forum.\n\n00:06:42:\n\nThey have, um a lot of people that air again, much more avid users shout out to the Nested Folders podcast.\n\n00:06:50:\n\nThey did a great to show seriess on how they both use. DEVONthink in their own systems.\n\n00:06:59:\n\nOne, uh, uses it more of, ah, file cabinet, the other one more of ah ah, thought companion.\n\n00:07:10:\n\nBut there's an app that I wanted to talk about a little bit from the business side, and this is after I haven't used a hun.\n\n00:07:23:\n\nBut I've used it.\n\n00:07:25:\n\nAnd when I have used it, it has had a really good effect.\n\n00:07:30:\n\nUh, I used to do business meetings any type of any time I was doing, like a client consultation.\n\n00:07:36:\n\nI would use something like notion.\n\n00:07:39:\n\nUm, I'm a firm believer in the idea of shared notes are better when you're able to collaborate on them.\n\n00:07:50:\n\nThe one problem that I had with notion initially was that you know, you get us up in account, you got to give them access, they can watch, you do stuff, and that's cool.\n\n00:07:59:\n\nBut ultimately, it doesn't feel as inviting for someone that's not a part of your team to come in and start working with you.\n\n00:08:07:\n\nAnd there was also, like the pricing question and things like that.\n\n00:08:10:\n\nBut for the last couple of consultations that I've had, I have used a tool called Miro. MIRO is an interesting little tool.\n\n00:08:22:\n\nIt is basically a collaborative white board, and it's designed to be a collaborative white board. One of the things I like about is that it also gives you a section for your notes. It allows you to attach things. It allows you to collect a bunch of stuff under one umbrella.\n\n00:08:38:\n\nI mean, imagine having a giant whiteboard and being able to just have everybody writing on it and asking questions and commenting and doing things like that.\n\n00:08:49:\n\nI really like it, Um, especially for like a consultation type thing.\n\n00:08:57:\n\nI haven't used it at the premium level where they have stuff like of voice and video chat and stuff like that.\n\n00:09:06:\n\nI mean, just you zoom.\n\n00:09:08:\n\nOr I think in my last consultation call, I like, I think we just use facetime and then, as we were talking, you know, we're both adding stuff into it so that's cool by itself.\n\n00:09:21:\n\nBut yeah, I mean, again, just this isn't an attempt to get people to try stuff.\n\n00:09:27:\n\nIt's more of Ah, hey, here's something that if you haven't heard about it and it's something that it suits you, then sure, why not take a crack at it?\n\n00:09:34:\n\nIt's not gonna be life changing for someone unless it is the exact thing that they're looking for.\n\n00:09:42:\n\nSo we've talked a little bit about the productivity side of things.\n\n00:09:47:\n\nLet's jump into the projects.\n\n00:09:51:\n\nAh, but to do nothings really changed much on the project side of life.\n\n00:09:55:\n\nI mean, it is it's still basically render engine and transcript.\n\n00:09:59:\n\nOr for me, I do believe the last time we had a conversation like this transcriptor was still just a Django app now it is no longer Django app.\n\n00:10:09:\n\nIt is a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor/).\n\n00:10:13:\n\nYes, but he s the best way to put it.\n\n00:10:16:\n\nAt the end of the day, I realized that I don't want to build a SaaS app.\n\n00:10:21:\n\nI know that there are a bunch of people out there.\n\n00:10:23:\n\nThey're like, \"Oh, yeah, SaaS applications!\"\n\n00:10:25:\n\n\"That's passive income and smart revenue.\"\n\n00:10:28:\n\nAnd there's a whole conversation to have about that.\n\n00:10:31:\n\nBut that is not me.\n\n00:10:33:\n\nWhat I enjoy doing more than anything is helping people directly by me providing a service to them.\n\n00:10:41:\n\nNow I know that's not scalable.\n\n00:10:43:\n\nI understand that.\n\n00:10:45:\n\nI don't care.\n\n00:10:46:\n\nUm, there's a excellent book that I've been reading on and off, you know, for the last who knows how long.\n\n00:10:52:\n\nCalled _Company of One__ by Paul Jarvis.\n\n00:10:55:\n\nI think that there is an amazing idea and an amazing benefit to imposing a limit of scalability on yourself and on your company.\n\n00:11:09:\n\nAnd here's Here's what I mean, if I use pit transcriptor, as you know, we'll pick transcript of the Django app.\n\n00:11:17:\n\nIt's a great tool that allows anybody to sign up for an account and start doing transcriptions and Ultimately, I'm eating the cost, which means I'm having to charge people memberships, which means I am now in the business of customer service.\n\n00:11:31:\n\nI'm in the business of tech support, and I am in the business of having to explain to people why Amazon transcribe does some of the things that it does because of how it does it.\n\n00:11:44:\n\nAnd there are a lot of different things that Amazon transcribe Google Cloud Platform or Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\n00:11:54:\n\nAll of these services do certain things because they have to in order to scale at the level that they want to scale.\n\n00:12:03:\n\nBut what's the alternative here?\n\n00:12:07:\n\nI could build a system that allows me personally to do transcriptions at a rate that I can afford in that I could maintain and by providing it as a python package.\n\n00:12:22:\n\nThere is a level of support that I'm willing to give, but a lot of that is I can now define the scope of the application of the package that I'm supporting.\n\n00:12:37:\n\nIf I decide that the transcript or packages on Lee going to support AWS Transcribe, then okay, I have the ability to do that if I decide that transcriptor is not going to support custom vocabulary.\n\n00:13:03:\n\nI can do that if I and these are all things that I have chosen to do.\n\n00:13:13:\n\nIf I decide that transcript is only going to focus on the resulted output of a transcription job and not the actual processing of the job itself, I conduce that.\n\n00:13:29:\n\nAnd by doing that, I narrow the scope that I am responsible for to my clients.\n\n00:13:38:\n\nI'm Onley responsible for the actual job that they're paying me to do.\n\n00:13:47:\n\nThey're not paying me to maintain a python packages or maintaining Meteo or they're paying me too.\n\n00:13:52:\n\nProvide them with a transcription.\n\n00:13:57:\n\nAnd the developers that are using the tool that I have built are I mean, they're not paying me at all, but they're relying on me, too.\n\n00:14:10:\n\nProvide a level of knowledge and service about the platform, or about the system that I have created all while while having the ability to take it and make it their own because it is an open source.\n\n00:14:25:\n\nA pack same thing with render engine render engine by default as a static side generator is designed to be very flexible, but because I'm not selling static sites is a service.\n\n00:14:45:\n\nI'm only providing a system for generating sites.\n\n00:14:52:\n\nThat is a level of insight that I don't have to provide.\n\n00:14:56:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper SEO.\n\n00:14:59:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper CDN usage and compression of images and things like that.\n\n00:15:05:\n\nMy system does not care about these things.\n\n00:15:09:\n\nIt does not benefit them anyway.\n\n00:15:11:\n\nThe only way that we were able to integrate sire like a search capability, like for those who don't know, one of the big achievements of he had this year for render engine is the integration in with a fuse dot Js, which is a static site search.\n\n00:15:30:\n\nUm, that's all done on the client side.\n\n00:15:34:\n\nBasically, you supply a JavaScript package with a JSON Output and you can search that file poor content.\n\n00:15:46:\n\nNow they're probably better ways to do it.\n\n00:15:50:\n\nI'm sure you could offload that to another service, but my assumption is if you're building static sites, you have a certain thought about offloading stuff to third party service.\n\n00:16:07:\n\nUm, but, you know, part of my thought pattern was Do I want to support looter?\n\n00:16:14:\n\nAnother static site search engine do I want to support, um, elastic search and do I want to support?\n\n00:16:23:\n\nYou know, Al Gore, Uh, or out was What is it?\n\n00:16:28:\n\nYeah, Al Gore as either Algora or Algoria.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nSomething like that.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nI think it's Algora.\n\n00:16:33:\n\nAnd because I wasn't saying, \"Hey, everybody, here's a platform that, you know, you give me $10 a month and I host your static site.\"\n\n00:16:45:\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with people that are doing that.\n\n00:16:47:\n\nYou know, shout out to the whole micro.blog service and Manton Reese and Jene McDonald and the other people that are a part of making that a reality.\n\n00:16:56:\n\nUm, that's just not me.\n\n00:16:58:\n\nThat's just not what I'm aiming to do.\n\n00:17:01:\n\nI would much rather make sure stuff that I'm doing is compatible with what they're doing.\n\n00:17:06:\n\nAnd they have really made that easy.\n\n00:17:07:\n\nSo again, big shout out to them.\n\n00:17:12:\n\nSo I guess in this rambling that is kind of my big take away in this whole conversation is there's something to say about the idea of controlling the scope of your projects, and that is something that I am learning more and more of as I get older and as I want to do more things while having more responsibilities is, I have to be able to control the scope of what I'm doing.\n\n00:17:50:\n\nSo the big pit question for you that I want to hear about, whether it's on Twitter or whether you want to email me at info it productivity in tech dot com is how are you controlling the scope of the things that you're doing?\n\n00:18:13:\n\nAnd furthermore, what can you do in order to begin controlling the scope of some things that might have gotten out of control?\n\n00:18:30:\n\nI'm gonna leave it there because the last, you know, five minutes or so of this little podcast thing, it's going to be devoted to a little bit of, ah administration work here.\n\n00:18:45:\n\nSo I've been thinking more and more about Pitt as a community, as a group of people Maurin Mawr during this time with racial injustice and things like that happening.\n\n00:19:04:\n\nHave I not been more proud of the black community that I've been a part of, you know, obviously from birth, but also the vocal community and the amount of ally ship that I have around me and that has made me want to value the people within that community.\n\n00:19:29:\n\nMore and more now, I'm still not sure how that involves pit, but what I have learned is that I want to be able to support of the things and the people that are doing amazing things more and more.\n\n00:19:50:\n\nAnd by doing that, I have to have the support of the community.\n\n00:19:55:\n\nSo here is my I thought I would be willing toe have more conversations like this on a regular basis if there were some form of feedback one, there has to be feedback on it.\n\n00:20:23:\n\nI don't I don't mind shouting into the either, but the actual time it takes tow, edit and record this.\n\n00:20:29:\n\nAnd I mean, even the editing isn't much, but I cough a lot.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm an asthmatic.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm a chronic asthmatic.\n\n00:20:34:\n\nThere's a lot of coughing that's involved in a lot of people.\n\n00:20:36:\n\nSometimes here and then sometimes don't hear, depending on my mood.\n\n00:20:43:\n\nOne.\n\n00:20:44:\n\nThere's got to be feedback in the term and in actual like conversation.\n\n00:20:51:\n\nI'm only sharing this stuff with you because I want to start a conversation.\n\n00:20:58:\n\nIf there's no desire for a conversation to be had then I have no reason to continues speaking about it.\n\n00:21:10:\n\nThe other side is it has to make sense from a time value perspective.\n\n00:21:18:\n\nAs some may noticed, I have upped the transparency of me searching for, um, I want to say a job, but searching for a way to provide for my family?\n\n00:21:33:\n\nNo, I have a job.\n\n00:21:36:\n\nI'm not worried about getting fired today, at least, and pit is still growing.\n\n00:21:43:\n\nI mean, last year was the best year for pit, which I mean.\n\n00:21:47:\n\nLuckily, the company's only two years old, so you know, hopefully, hopefully we can continue moving in a positive direction.\n\n00:21:58:\n\nBut the time that it takes to record this I'm currently sitting at 22 minutes, 39 seconds.\n\n00:22:05:\n\nI think on the actual recording, it's like 22 minutes, five seconds, something like that.\n\n00:22:10:\n\nBut I was working on a transcription before I started doing this, and I said, You know what?\n\n00:22:16:\n\nI really need to get that thing done.\n\n00:22:17:\n\nSo if I'm going to do more things like that, I need to make sure that I'm not taking away time from my family without it making sense from a from a value perspective.\n\n00:22:37:\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\n00:22:41:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be a patri on?\n\n00:22:42:\n\nNo.\n\n00:22:43:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be ah member full or something like that?\n\n00:22:47:\n\nNo, I don't know what it means at the moment.\n\n00:22:51:\n\nWhat I'm looking for is one person.\n\n00:22:56:\n\nI'm looking for a couple things.\n\n00:22:57:\n\nI'm looking for two people to listen to this and tell me that they heard it.\n\n00:23:02:\n\nThey enjoyed it or they heard it and they didn't enjoy it.\n\n00:23:05:\n\nAnd here's why.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nOr they heard it.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nAnd I'm an idiot or whatever.\n\n00:23:09:\n\nThe other thing I want to hear is someone say I have heard this.\n\n00:23:13:\n\nI appreciate it.\n\n00:23:15:\n\nIt brought me value.\n\n00:23:17:\n\nAnd I want to, in some way, shape or form compensate you for the value that you've put out.\n\n00:23:27:\n\nNow, if you feel like you can't afford that, by all means, I understand I'm not even saying that you have to feel obligated to give me money.\n\n00:23:39:\n\nI am saying that if this truly brings value to you and you feel like you would be willing to do something to ensure that this value continued to happen, I need to know, because otherwise all I'm doing is wasting my time and my energy putting something out there that no one's listening to now, the pit podcast as a whole.\n\n00:24:07:\n\nThe interviews they will still happen because I enjoy.\n\n00:24:09:\n\nI enjoy the conversations.\n\n00:24:12:\n\nAt the present time, I have five six interviews scheduled in like the next month.\n\n00:24:24:\n\nI can stretch those out for the remainder of the year, and that will be the entire pit season.\n\n00:24:30:\n\nOr I can release them on a bi weekly, maybe even weekly basis, like we used to back in the good old days.\n\n00:24:40:\n\nBut I'm not going to do that at the stake of my sanity, knowing that it's not going to make an impact in anyone's life or knowing that the people who are consuming it are just using.\n\n00:24:54:\n\nIt is background noise.\n\n00:24:55:\n\nI cannot do that.\n\n00:24:57:\n\nSo here's the promise that I'm making today as I'm recording this and this will be released is June 10th.\n\n00:25:05:\n\nIf by June 20th we have one pledge to somehow pay for this service, you know, pay for this podcast, not even not even monetarily.\n\n00:25:21:\n\nMaybe it's just in terms of like, Hey, I promise that if you put in episode, I will retweet it and I will reply with a comment.\n\n00:25:30:\n\nI am okay with that being the currency.\n\n00:25:33:\n\nI love your money.\n\n00:25:34:\n\nBut if you don't have it, I understand.\n\n00:25:37:\n\nSome of us just don't have it.\n\n00:25:40:\n\nAnd if I have two people that can just say Hey, you know what?\n\n00:25:44:\n\nI really enjoyed the conversation.\n\n00:25:45:\n\nI really enjoyed the thought piece.\n\n00:25:47:\n\nThis is what I did like.\n\n00:25:48:\n\nThis is what I didn't like.\n\n00:25:49:\n\nMaybe a little too much preaching at the end.\n\n00:25:53:\n\nWhatever it is.\n\n00:25:55:\n\n10 days.\n\n00:25:57:\n\nI will talk about this every single day.\n\n00:25:59:\n\nI will tweet it out every single day.\n\n00:26:01:\n\nI will give it my full up.\n\n00:26:03:\n\nDo a transcription for it.\n\n00:26:05:\n\nI will do everything possible to make sure that people hear this.\n\n00:26:13:\n\nAnd if again, two people tell me, Give me some feedback.\n\n00:26:19:\n\nOne person pledges some type of either money or effort in terms of a currency.\n\n00:26:27:\n\nThen I will continue to do this and I will pledge to release the episodes that I'm recording at a bi weekly basis.\n\n00:26:33:\n\nStarting out if we get more than that and I feel like I can truly start doing this on a weekly basis, then by all means, that's awesome.\n\n00:26:40:\n\nBut if not, I have to think about the effort that I'm putting in, and I have to think about the find that it's taking away from my family and things like that.\n\n00:26:54:\n\nI have no problem with it.\n\n00:26:55:\n\nMy family has no problem with it, but ultimately we and by we I mean me.\n\n00:27:02:\n\nI I want to share this content with you, but I don't want it to fall on deaf ears, and I don't want it to just be background noise for someone's commute.\n\n00:27:12:\n\nI want to be something that they take in and that they value.\n\n00:27:15:\n\nSo that's my pledge to you.\n\n00:27:16:\n\nLike I said, two pieces of feedback.\n\n00:27:18:\n\nOne pledge.\n\n00:27:19:\n\nIf you can make that happen, then the podcasts interviews will go on a biweekly schedule, and I will probably supplement the interviews with more thoughts like this, just less preachiness on the back end.\n\n00:27:31:\n\nBut that's gonna do it for

You could go to my website [kjaymiller.com](https://kjaymiller.com).\n\n00:27:57:\n\nUh, there might be a contact button there.\n\n00:28:00:\n\nThere might not be?\n\n00:28:01:\n\nNo, actually.\n\n00:28:02:\n\nNow, you can't really do that when there's no contact button.\n\n00:28:04:\n\nI'm also a microdot.\n\n00:28:05:\n\nBlawg at KJ.\n\n00:28:07:\n\nWhy Miller, if you use microdot block instead of Twitter.\n\n00:28:10:\n\nBut if you want to be invited into our privates like channel, I'll bet you.\n\n00:28:15:\n\nBut if I like, If I like the cut of your jib, then sure, we'll bring you in.\n\n00:28:21:\n\nUm, once we have enough, people will start an open conversation about how we can make this work financially.\n\n00:28:31:\n\nI'm open to doing more things like this, whether they're a live stream, whether we're having, like, voice, call, conversation, stuff or whatever.\n\n00:28:40:\n\nBut more than anything, I just want to make sure that people are hearing this and that people are getting something out of it.\n\n00:28:46:\n\nBut that's gonna do it for this time.\n\n00:28:49:\n\nI'm Jay Miller.\n\n00:28:49:\n\nThank you so much for listening.\n\n00:28:52:\n\nUh, thank you to Nadir Omowale for the use of his music a \"hustler in spite of myself\" for the intro and outro music.\n\n00:28:59:\n\nAnd of course, I hope for the last 29 minutes and five seconds that we have been productive.\n\n00:29:06:\n\nThank you so much.\n\n00:29:08:\n\nI will talk to you next time.", "title": "[PIT Podcast] Getting Real and Narrowing Scope",
