My family grew up fishing, bowling, and enjoying Tennessee Sports. My grandfather allowed me to learn about computing on his gateway 2000 PC. He also showed me my favorite video game of all time, Tetris.\n\nAfter high school, I joined the United States Marine Corps and spent most of my days deployed across southeast Asia. There, I grew a love for understanding people and how their culture shapes their design, fashion, architecture and art.\n\nIn 2014 I started podcasting with the [Productivity in Tech Podcast]. That eventually grew into a business where I work with developer creators to make content around their brand.\n\nThese days I've settle in Sunny (Most of the Time) San Diego, California where I (along with my wonderful wife) raise our little J (literally her name is Jae pronouced like my name), along with our two dogs (Alice, and The Loris) and our Cat Boss, Peanut Butter.\n\n\n[Productivity in Tech Podcast]: https://podcast.productivityintech.com\n[multipotentialite]: https://puttylike.com/terminology/", "title": "Who is Jay Miller", "slug": "about", "url": "/about", "routes": "['', 'pages']", "template": "page.html"}, {"base_content": "## I LOVE COFFEE!\n\nI'm always on the hunt for new cofee to sip on. \n\nThis will be a landing page for coffee's that I've tried and things.

Jay Miller here bringing another Productivity in Tech Podcast. I hope that your day has been great, and I hope that the conversation that I'm about tohave will make it even better on the line with me Today I have the host of the I Don't know if it's the first, but it is definitely in the\n\nJay 00:00:42:\n\n1st 3 podcasts that I ever listened to. Tom Merritt. He is the host of the Daily Tech News Show. He is also the co host work Insanity. Current Geek East Meets West. He is a published author of The Pilot X Series, the second book Trigger, Now available for digital download. And he is also a contributor to Tech Republic.\n\nJay 00:01:08:\n\nTom, Did I get Everything\n\nTom 00:01:11:\n\nI\n\nTom 00:01:11:\n\nknow, But I do weigh too much. And to be honest, it would be ridiculous to expect you\n\nTom 00:01:16:\n\nto get everything that covers more than enough. Thank you for having me, man.\n\nJay 00:01:20:\n\nAbsolutely. And Tom is one of the few people that have been on this show more than once. Ah, he was actually a guest on what we call the before times\n\nJay 00:01:31:\n\nin that initial feed that was lost. But\n\nJay 00:01:34:\n\nI have always looked up to you, Tom, as\n\nJay 00:01:39:\n\nthe\n\nJay 00:01:42:\n\nlike, the idea of professionalism in podcasting, whether it is the stories of, like, I think, um, smr podcast Folks have said like\n\nJay 00:01:52:\n\nwe have to jump in the call like, an hour early. We're going through nodes and everybody's got cues. And everything's, like all synchronized and and, you know, working with producers and and just jumping on board with patri on at a really early stage and and allowing that to\n\nJay 00:02:10:\n\nbasically go from an empire with Was it seen at that you were with or\n\nTom 00:02:16:\n\nI was with Seen it for 2004 through 2010? Yeah,\n\nJay 00:02:21:\n\nI feel like the knowledge that I have on this is like nard war level? Probably not. Nor, uh, are you familiar with not, uh what is it? Nard war? No. What's Nard war? He is a Vancouver Ah, deejay that interviews like a lot of hip hop artists and the level of research that he goes through is absolutely scary at times. He's like, back in 1991 when you were, you know, doing you know, freestyles in the Bronx. You took this picture with run d m C And what were those shoes that you're aware? And he's like, Oh, you were wearing these? Yeah, I've brought a pair of those for you today.\n\nJay 00:03:02:\n\nLike, Yeah, it's crazy. The scary thing is, I didn't have to do any research. Like, you are very good at what you do in that\n\nJay 00:03:14:\n\nPeople know what Europe Teoh. They know,\n\nJay 00:03:18:\n\nlike I'm always finding something new that you've done. And then I'm like, Okay, Wow. Like here. Here's this thing. And then I immediately start following it for years and years and years. Uh, can you say that that's, like, kind of the gist of Of the\n\nJay 00:03:36:\n\nI don't want to say, like your product or your brand Is that\n\nJay 00:03:40:\n\ndo you think it's more like, Hi, I'm Tom Merit of DCNS fame. Or is it or is it now? Like I am Tom Merit and the people that know me know me.\n\nTom 00:03:49:\n\nYeah, well, so thanks, man. Appreciate all the kind words I really don't know. It's something I'm always struggling to figure out is you know, what is that position? Ah, that is most common. I generally think it's probably host of daily tech new show because that is the show that I have with the largest number of listeners, and so it's more likely that somebody knows me from that\n\nTom 00:04:11:\n\nthan anything else. And it is the heir to tech news today and buzz out loud, which were similar shows that I did before. So I sort of feel like when I have to introduce myself in a short period of time or if someone just asked me like, What's your show? And I don't want to get into, You know, all the side projects I have. I'll just say Daily technician Usually\n\nJay 00:04:32:\n\nI forgot one. It's a thing, another\n\nTom 00:04:36:\n\nthat probably launched three since we started talking. That's just you can never give up\n\nJay 00:04:42:\n\nwell, And that was something that, you know you mentioned earlier. Is that you? It's almost assigned that you do too much. Uh, how How are you balancing all of these different things?\n\nJay 00:04:56:\n\nYeah, it's something\n\nTom 00:04:58:\n\nthat I enjoy doing. I mean, that that is the key to all of it is that I have very carefully ah, whittled away the things I don't enjoy doing and have luckily been able to make what I enjoy doing my work, which then means I have to find time to do all the ideas that I have. And honestly, that's something I've only just recently solved because after I left twit Ah, and they replaced me. I had to start\n\nTom 00:05:26:\n\non my own. I started as many things as possible, figuring nal of them would stick. But I needed to, you know, have a bunch of irons in the fire and most of them stuck. So for a long time, I was like, I don't have any room in my schedule to make something new And it wasn't until I brought on help for mostly for daily Tech news show,\n\nTom 00:05:47:\n\nbut also for we're doing a reboot of of the current Keep podcast. Ah, for that as well that I loosened up enough to be able to say, Okay, now I can take some time away from time to time. Now I can have people you know, come in and and and do some of the heavy lifting, the producing, even script writing. Ah, and that allows me to kind of back off and be able to doom or without having to burn myself out. It was it was a big thing that had to be careful of was burned out. And the key to that was learning to let go where, you know, not even just trust, cause I trust all the people I work with just being able to say yes. Okay, I will. I will. I will let go of this, even though I enjoy doing it.\n\nJay 00:06:31:\n\nYou know, that's that's been something that,\n\nJay 00:06:34:\n\nyou know, you talked about burnout. Like I feel like burnout is one of those things. It's like a mental precursor to your body, physically burning out. Oh, yeah. Um, I kind of shared a little bit of the story with you, you know, beforehand. But like, it took my body literally breaking down for me to be like, Whoa, I need to dial things back a little bit and\n\nJay 00:06:57:\n\nslowly reintroduce\n\nJay 00:07:00:\n\nsome of the things that I miss and that I enjoy. And even now, like, productivity in tech is one of those things that every time I'm like, we're going to go on a break like by a month, I'm just like I want to do more interviews. I want toe do something else. I want to bring it out.\n\nJay 00:07:18:\n\nHow have you prevented yourself from not starting projects. I know that's that. That's like the tough part, because, um I think Justin McElroy said it earlier this week on one of his podcast that he's now doing woodworking. But he doesn't want to talk about it, because if he talks about it to the Internet for more than Like a minute, there will be a new podcast for him,\n\nTom 00:07:38:\n\nright? Ah, it's It's tough. I mean, part of it is like you say, realizing that if you put too much stress on yourself mentally, it will affect you physically. And you know it's on all too common story that you know, you you have to have a scare\n\nTom 00:07:56:\n\nto make yourself adapt to. That s so keeping that in mind and paying attention to how you feel. Ah, and sort of associating, You know, if I take a break, if I take time off, if I don't do things, if I schedule things\n\nTom 00:08:13:\n\nto give myself time off, I feel better, like just making that connection, forcing yourself to make that connection, eso that you're not overworking yourself and you're not feeling guilty. In my case, I would feel guilty like I should be working I should be doing these things. I have these things I want to do. I enjoy them. Why am I not doing them? And the key was to say, Because you'll you'll hurt yourself. If you do that right, it's It's like too much of a good thing is always a danger. Ah, and and so if you enjoy doing something that that's no exception So, yeah, I mean, a\n\nJay 00:08:44:\n\nI don't know what\n\nTom 00:08:45:\n\nthe the trick is, but I've just sort of emphasized to myself that there have to be limits. There have to be and we talk about this on work, insanity a lot. There have to be beginnings and ends to the workday. There have to be breaks where I'm not working. Ah, and I've just worked really hard to to take advantage of that and give myself permission to do that\n\nJay 00:09:04:\n\nKind of, Ah, little tech. I guess nerd is something that I did. I use its will called keyboard maestro on my Mac and at quitting time. At my day job, I get a notification that says OK, timeto to wrap it up and it will start looking at what applications I have open and after two minutes. If I haven't closed all of like my community, my email, my communication, all that's up, it will promptly save everything and close them for me and say,\n\nTom 00:09:34:\n\nWow,\n\nTom 00:09:35:\n\nthat's intense. Yeah, you know, I mean, you got to do what you gotta do, right?\n\nJay 00:09:39:\n\nYeah, And I think that that's That's one of the things that, like you said When you enjoy the work that you do it, it does become hard to say. Okay, I'm gonna work until this time. And then after that, there are more important things that I need to tend to, like I have my wife and my daughter and, like I I want to.\n\nJay 00:09:59:\n\nI have to be aware of the time that I'm taking away from them, because if I spend all day, you know, at my computer, then all of a sudden I go in. I'm like, Oh, what's for dinner? And then I look around. It's like, Oh, wait, why's everybody asleep? And that's just that's not\n\nJay 00:10:16:\n\ngood. It's not healthy. It's not healthy for my family. It's not healthy for me. Ah, it's It's one of those things that it takes again. It takes learning the hard way. Ah, before you're like, OK, whatever it takes for me to make sure that I go, I'm done right now.\n\nJay 00:10:33:\n\nThat's what I have to dio.\n\nTom 00:10:35:\n\nYeah, I've redirected some of my energy into things that will make me feel better entered and healthier. Eso You know, instead of going on to the next computer project, I'll get up and this, You know, the past couple of months, we we planted some carrots and tomatoes. So I go out and I work in the garden. And that gets me son because my doctors like you need vitamin D and and And then I get, you know, I've got a step count that I'm trying to hit. And then so that helps me get to that. And so, you know, I take some of that goal oriented behavior and and and try to redirect it into things that will help the problem rather than exacerbating it.\n\nJay 00:11:16:\n\nAbsolutely. And I wanted to talk about that. I mean, how do you approach new things? I know that you think when we first spoke, you were launching Pilot X, and now I mean you're launching treat well. You've launched trigger at this point. I think there's some weird shipping stuff going on. Do toe?\n\nTom 00:11:34:\n\nYeah. The book in the audiobook are out there, the print books. Still in a warehouse somewhere, I think. I think they're very close to being able to visit the warehouse safely, so hopefully those will start shipping.\n\nJay 00:11:45:\n\nOh, man. Never thought you'd be would be having these kinds of numbers.\n\nJay 00:11:50:\n\nI can't get my books out of a warehouse. I mean, yeah, okay. It makes sense now, Um,\n\nJay 00:11:55:\n\nbut yeah, like,\n\nJay 00:11:57:\n\ntalk a little bit about, Like how That's very different than putting out a daily new show. Just the idea of didn't you Self published this one and the last one Or\n\nTom 00:12:08:\n\nnow Pilot X and Trigger are through a company called Inc Shares that is a traditional publisher, but they they use crowd sourcing for choosing the books. So you have to get a certain number of people to commit to buying the book ahead of time, and then you'll be ableto publish. And and then it works. Just like any other publisher with editors and marketing and all of that. Ah, but I did sell, publish a lot of others before and really with the books. It's just again. It's something. It's a sideline that I enjoy. I have a task for myself, too, right? Or edit every day. Ah, and so it's just built in that I'm always working on something, even if it's for 10 minutes. Ah, I just I'm always working on something. And then eventually I'll have Manu scripts and I'll want to share those. I want toe to put those out and find a way to get those into the hands of people that might want to read it,\n\nJay 00:13:01:\n\nincluding, you know, joining the ranks of of, I guess, jury fame with a free newsletter. And we're not free news that What was it Free? Tom's, Tom's\n\nTom 00:13:12:\n\nthree Top those letters dot com? Yeah, also, I mean really done at the behest of Justin Robbery of Jerry. Yeah,\n\nJay 00:13:19:\n\nI need to get up. I've met. I've met jury once and alive show he did in San Diego with broken and it was funny and strange at the same time because we're both Harston players and I mean, you know, jury, it's like\n\nJay 00:13:37:\n\nas much of a character as he is. He's also kind of like\n\nJay 00:13:41:\n\nOkay, cool. Everybody's happy I'm going to go like, take a breath and, like, step away and like you just catches me Playing Harston over in the corner is like, OK, and then, like that starts a whole conversation. I'm like, Yeah, great show data, data, data. Brian sucks sometimes because he supposed to been on this show like, three years ago. And he emailed me, like, two months ago. Like, hey was not supposed to do a thing\n\nJay 00:14:03:\n\nthat sounds like Brian This'll wasn't supposed to be a dig on Brian, but yeah, like it. It is so interesting. And one of the reasons why I wanted to kind of question the idea of, like, product versus brand waas\n\nJay 00:14:19:\n\nYou have put around you. Um and this is probably another question for, like, Scott Johnson who will have to have on the show and everyone else That's a part of this group. And, um,\n\nJay 00:14:29:\n\nlike I won't say the diamond club, but like diamond group frog pants, Like all of these ancillary groups that are around what you're doing,\n\nJay 00:14:38:\n\nit seems like there is a\n\nJay 00:14:42:\n\ncommunity that is\n\nJay 00:14:47:\n\nalmost like YouTube mega star esque in that\n\nJay 00:14:54:\n\nyou can talk about a thing such as folding at home, which, for those who don't know folding at home, was, ah, project where people could donate. Resource is on their own machine to help solve some of the algorithmic problems for figuring out a cure for covert 19 on. I think before that it was something else. But\n\nJay 00:15:15:\n\nthe team jumps in and then becomes, like breaks the top 100 of like groups within a matter of weeks. And\n\nJay 00:15:25:\n\nit's like\n\nJay 00:15:27:\n\nthere isn't really a\n\nJay 00:15:30:\n\ndemand or request from the Group it czar from the leaders of the group. It is usually Hey, we're doing a thing. If you want to join in, Here you go. Wow, look at how many of you joined in? Has that been something that you've\n\nJay 00:15:47:\n\nyou've kind of grown and nurtured over time? Or is it something that just kind of, like happened?\n\nJay 00:15:53:\n\nYeah, it's It's\n\nTom 00:15:54:\n\nboth, Ah, the the group of podcasters that I that I, you know, have on the show and communicate with and and and cross promote with those air friends, those air people that I'm like. I not only like you, but I like what you do. Ah, and and I think that's super important Ah, as part of it, Which is when I have Allison Sheridan on my show. When I have Chris Ashley on my show, when I have Scott Johnson on my show, you can tell that that we all respect and get along with each other. And I think that makes for better content that it really does. And then that, in turn, provides an example for the community building around all of these shows to be like OK, so they're respectful. They get along with each other. Uh, let's be the same lets you know, and people who don't really want to do that kind of wander often and and do something else I've said it before is you get the audience you deserve, which is, you know, maybe a little negative wayto to express that. But I think your audience is a reflection of your product of your show of of the of how you present yourself, um,\n\nTom 00:17:07:\n\nand and the community that I have has long roots. I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at Cnet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.\n\nJay 00:17:49:\n\nWell, let's\n\nJay 00:17:51:\n\nI want to give some some, like actual tangible help to those out there that might be thinking of following maybe not the tech news route, but\n\nJay 00:18:03:\n\nbuilding some form of community around content that they do. What What are some of those things that I guess people starting out\n\nJay 00:18:13:\n\nneed to be cognizant of and ultimately need to do to? I can't say to guarantee success because that's not possible. But Teoh truly give them the best possible\n\nJay 00:18:26:\n\nchance at building something similar to what you've done.\n\nTom 00:18:29:\n\nYeah, I mean, some of it is luck, some of its longevity Ah, but but there there are some things I think I can pull out that might be useful to folks. Ah, and one is, you know, being genuine, being yourself being authentic. People will notice that they were, and then they will gather around that. And it will be very easy for you to maintain that because it's you Ah, and will help you avoid a lot of problems in the future because you are just being you. And so when you make mistakes, your audience will be more understanding because they know like, Oh, well, I understand him because he's always been or her or whatever. Ah, I understand them because they have been themselves with me. And so I I get what's going on, uh, also giving your community of voice. I think a super important, and it is as simple as reading emails. I mean, it could take all kinds of other forms. It could be Twitter and Instagram and Facebook groups and discords and slacks and and all of that, and those are all great ways to do it, too. But just giving your community of voice in what you do, I think, is super important. And that's one of the lessons I learned way back a tech TV like just reading someone's email on a show\n\nTom 00:19:41:\n\nreally does make their day. Ah, and they and they will become a fan forever\n\nTom 00:19:47:\n\nin a lot of cases just because of that moment. But it also builds dialogue. And so it shouldn't just be one way. It's It should also, you know, you should be able to have conversations with people. And again it could just be over email, uh, or in chats or discords or whatever, but having\n\nTom 00:20:05:\n\nsome way to bring it your community into your show so that they feel a part of it. So they are a part of it and and also, uh, addressing people back so that they feel like you are, in fact listening for for at the beginning that's so easy. If you're starting out, you won't get overwhelmed. You won't have too many people writing in, so you can personally answer every email you get and\n\nJay 00:20:32:\n\nyou can be selective.\n\nTom 00:20:33:\n\nYou don't You don't have to read every single email on the show because you do want tohave. The feedback you include in the show be representative of the kind of feedback you'd want from your community. But if you're communicating back to people then you can explain that you could explain. Oh, the reason I didn't, you know, use your contribution was because of X, Y and Z.\n\nJay 00:20:51:\n\nSometimes that's\n\nTom 00:20:52:\n\ndifficult. Sometimes people will get upset and you have to be ready for that. That's part of community management, but it's it's really important to to try to do that. Ah, and to be transparent about how you're doing it so that people understand.\n\nJay 00:21:07:\n\nYou know, I think one of the\n\nJay 00:21:09:\n\nmost memorable times for me was probably the first time that I felt like I had any type of knowledge to contribute\n\nJay 00:21:18:\n\nto D. T and s And funny enough, who was actually from the morning stream because you were in Scott we're talking about, um I want to say it was e a removing the Tetris app from the APP store and I immediately e mailed in Onley because, like a week prior to that and I'm a big Tetris fan. Um but a week prior to that, I had watched like the to our long by, like, documentary Ah, Alexey pageant not who is the creator of Tetris and so still fresh in my mind. I had all of this knowledge. And I was like,\n\nJay 00:21:53:\n\nI can't wait to tell like, you know, Tom and Scott both about Like, I forgot what I remember. There was, like, something that was stated. They were like, Oh, I wonder why they're doing this or what?\n\nTom 00:22:04:\n\nHow the Russian government makes money from Tetris?\n\nJay 00:22:06:\n\nExactly. And I was like, Yeah, I mean, Russia. It's still kind of makes a little bit off of that. But there has been the terrorist organization and everything else that now works with Alexey Pajitnov to help. Kind of\n\nJay 00:22:21:\n\nmake sure he's taking care of because he can't technically get paid from Tetris because he built it using\n\nJay 00:22:28:\n\nequipment that he was using when he worked for the Russian government. Um, and in the end, I think the coolest part of that was the reply emails of just like Oh, that's cool. I did not know that. And then Scott saying Now I just want to play Tetris 99.\n\nJay 00:22:44:\n\nSo I definitely agree that\n\nJay 00:22:47:\n\neven when even when a reply like I knew my new my long winded response, there was no reason it ever needed to be aired because it was much more information than anyone could digest in, like, a couple of sentences. But just the fact that I knew that it was seen and I knew that it was responded to and it wasn't like, Oh, hey, great. Great insight. Thanks for the information. It was okay. Wow, This actually resonated Some kind of emotional feeling. And this is what that feeling Waas And to me, I thought that that meant the world to me in a way that I don't think that that you are Scot could ever imagine. Because that's what I was hoping. I was hoping that, like, I would strike a chord and be like, Oh, yeah, cool. That's awesome.\n\nTom 00:23:37:\n\nYeah. Yeah, well, and it's tough because they're gonna people be people who write in with something that they think is really important that maybe you you already know, right? Like like, if if you were doing this and someone wrote in to tell you about this this documentary about Tetris, you'd be like, Well, yeah, I already saw that. So, you know, it can be tricky. Yeah, you're not going to be able to make everybody's day all the time. Ah, but even when you just acknowledge it and And like I said, especially at the beginning, when you can like, I can't reply to every single person anymore. I try to I do read everything. I try to respond to his many as I can, but in the early times you can. And just that acknowledgement will help people, you know, really feel a part of your community.\n\nJay 00:24:26:\n\nWell,\n\nJay 00:24:27:\n\nI have enjoyed all of the different things that we have we've talked about, but I I would definitely want to give us enough time for this last question. Because\n\nJay 00:24:38:\n\nyou look a tech\n\nJay 00:24:40:\n\ndaily. You work with your community daily. You're trying new phones. You're trying new tools.\n\nJay 00:24:49:\n\nWhat is the state of tech for you these days? How are you feeling about\n\nJay 00:24:55:\n\nhow politicized technol technology companies air becoming how\n\nJay 00:25:00:\n\npoliticized? I guess everything is becoming these days, but that don't worry about that part. Um, but yeah, how\n\nJay 00:25:07:\n\nwhen you look at new tech or new technology, do you think Oh, this is cool? Or do you think this is something that now I have to cover or I have to do because it's my job?\n\nTom 00:25:16:\n\nYeah, I I definitely love doing this. I love solving the puzzle of what goes in the show every day and and figuring out like what's really behind\n\nTom 00:25:27:\n\nthis or that story like today that the day that we're recording this and I know this will date this a little bit if you really pay attention. But, uh, they were recording this. Germany released their covert 19 app. Now I could have just said Germany released their their covert 19 contact tracing app and be done with it. But I also noticed that France\n\nTom 00:25:48:\n\nwas had recently had problems with their at because they were using a different platform. And I noticed that the European Union had announced they wanted to do a, ah, an interoperability project between all the different countries in Europe. And so it was funded to be like, Oh, these three stories are one story. How do I, you know, connect those dots? I just really enjoy doing that. And\n\nTom 00:26:12:\n\nI feel like\n\nTom 00:26:14:\n\nnow I've been doing this long enough now feels, ah, lot like the early to mid two thousands because back in the early to mid two thousands, everybody was saying, Well, you know the dot com bust, That's it. You know what? What's gonna happen. There isn't anything new. These tech companies didn't work out. Ah, and that's a different thing that what we're experiencing now. But there's a similar flavor to it, which is, well, these tech companies, they're too big. They've stifled all the innovation. That's it. What do we do now? And to me, it's really exciting to be in that space where we don't know. We don't know what the next big new thing is gonna be. We don't know when the Google\n\nTom 00:26:56:\n\nto\n\nTom 00:26:57:\n\nMicrosoft is goingto happen to Google. You know, like we these companies were the ones that disrupted the companies of the nineties. Now they're huge. Uh, who's going to disrupt them? And the fact that it's not obvious to me is exciting. It's not. It's not depressing. It's like we haven't seen him yet. It could come from anywhere. You know, the most recent thing. We have to point to his tic tac. Ah, and some people may roll their eyes and like a great chick talk, you know, a bunch of kids making videos. It's like, Yeah, but you were rolling your eyes at Facebook. If you were having that same approach in 2007. Ah, and look where that got us So I don't know it z me. It's It's super, it's super fun and it's super exciting to watch that story continue to unfold. And we're in the build up of suspense to know when the next twist is gonna happen.\n\nJay 00:27:49:\n\nWell, I am personally looking forward to you covering that twist whenever it does happen, because again,\n\nJay 00:27:56:\n\nde et nous, I love that you have put it in a place that it feels it feels stronger than it's ever been. It feels like it's definitely not going anywhere, anytime soon. And they even let you take a break every now and then to come on little shows like this.\n\nTom 00:28:15:\n\nAh, yeah, man, it's It's It's fun. I'm glad it feels strong. It certainly feels good from within two. And I've gone from I'll be honest, like the 1st 4 years I was just, like is gonna fall apart at any moment, and I just know it. I was gonna keep this ball in the air, keep juggling as long as I can. Ah, and have finally come around, you know, in its 60 year to being like, Oh, you know, what this means. Stick around. This\n\nTom 00:28:41:\n\nmay have something here, so it feels good\n\nJay 00:28:44:\n\nthat that's interesting that you say that because that was me for the 1st 3 years of pit. It was just like, How do I make this better? How do I make it? You know, larger numbers, bigger downloads. Maybe I can advertise all these things. And then it got toe like Year Four. And now we're in your five, and it's like,\n\nJay 00:29:04:\n\nYou know what? I just want to enjoy having good conversations and and you'll hear a little bit of bad up as we get ready to wrap up the conversation. But But, Tom, I've enjoyed this, but we haven't after show to get to. So before we do that, please let everyone know where they can find out about the 14 15 16 17 things that you're working on at this moment.\n\nTom 00:29:29:\n\nSure, I try to keep everything up to date over a tom Merritt dot com. That's two hours and two teas. Ah, you can go there and and find pretty much everything I do. Ah, and the most recent thing that I've launched is no a little Mauritz. Ah, it's an independent podcast available in iTunes Spot a vile all those kinds of places. Ah, or if you're a patron of detainees, you'll get it there and it's just deep dives. Ah, it's it's why they let me leave Dtn s every once in a while to just work on one topic for an entire day and really, really dive into it. So check that out. No, a little more.\n\nJay 00:30:03:\n\nAnd I will have a link to your website as well as that new podcast in the show notes everyone you have been listening to Tom Merritt. I feel like I can say my good friend Tom Maier, because I I hear him every day of he doesn't hear me. But I talked to him every day. Um, but if you want\n\nJay 00:30:23:\n\nand un opinionated Wellings the un opinionated, if you want, like an unbiased news like brought to your ears every single day, Daily tech New show is the podcast.

So trust me when I say you want to go listen to the website or not listen to the website. See, I'm so used to listening to top Go visit the website, but that is going to do it for this episode of productivity in tech podcast\n\nJay 00:31:08:\n\nAs always,\n\nJay 00:31:10:\n\nI don't\n\nJay 00:31:12:\n\ndemand that you leave a review. I don't demand that you go tell 50 of your friends about the show. I only ask that as you're listening to this as you're listening to my guest that you've taken something from and you try to apply it to whatever it is you're doing.\n\nJay 00:31:29:\n\nAnd if you have done that and you want to tell me about it,\n\nJay 00:31:32:\n\nyou can do so on Twitter at KJ.

Um, all of the individual things that have happened in 2020 have just been nightmarish at best.\n\n00:00:46:\n\nSo this is going to be more of a productivity's side thought exercise for me, and I hope that it will engage your mind a little bit as we sit down and talk.\n\nThat said, it is gonna be a little bit off the head. I have some notes and I'll use those notes. But ultimately, I'm just using them to riff off of.\n\n00:01:13:\n\nSo let's start with a couple of things. First of all, productivity's in general. What am I doing, Productivity wise?\n\nUm, if you would have asked me this question yesterday, I would have told you something different. I am jumping back to the notebook. I go to the notebook like probably once a year. I'm gonna try to do a full year.\n\n00:01:38:\n\nDon't at me. Don't challenge me. Don't do any of those things the way that I see it productivity tools, productivity, apps, productivity. All of those things should be used for you to do your best work. None of these tools should be considered a Bible or any type of gospel for you to breach or proselytize on others.\n\n00:02:06:\n\nIn fact, I'm not using this podcast to preach or proselytize my own productivity method. I am merely telling people how I am doing a thing in hopes that if someone else that is doing something similar here, is it that I might be able to inspire them to try something that works for them or for them to reach out to me and let me know of something that did work for them without any obligation to join the Church of Notion or Rome research or obsidian or all these other apps that said, Let's jump into this.\n\n00:02:51:\n\nWhat absolute using. Like I said, up until today, when I said, You know what, we need to get back on our analog light, our BuJo-esque system.\n\n00:03:03:\n\nI would have said I was using OmniFocus. Um, I think for right now I I don't really have too much stuff in OmniFocus. That will make it hard to transition.\n\n00:03:19:\n\nI wasn't really using OmniFocus as the power tool that most people use it as, um, it was simply a way for me to differ things so that I didn't have to look at him.\n\nGood thing is a notebook and a piece of paper kind of does the same thing. I just don't need to look at it now.\n\n00:03:39:\n\nOne of the biggest apps that I have jumped on. Probably the biggest change in my workflow since leaving Evernote back in 2000 and what, 10? Yeah, I think 2010 was when I left Evernote or not.\n\n00:03:57:\n\nDidn't leave it like the company I stopped using.\n\n00:03:59:\n\nThe application is the adoption of DEVONthink now, DEVONthink, is one of these tools that I think that a lot of people are intimidated by one.\n\n00:04:13:\n\nIt's an expensive tool.\n\n00:04:15:\n\nI get that. Yeah, it's expensive.\n\n00:04:17:\n\nOh, boy, A suspensive.\n\nIt's like fountain pen money expensive.\n\n00:04:23:\n\nThe thing I like about DEVONthink is I don't have to question where I put a thing.\n\n00:04:31:\n\nI deal with a lot of files between the day job, the side business and the other ambitions and inspirations that I have.\n\n00:04:42:\n\nSo for me, it is important that when I'm looking for a thing, I can find it with relative ease.\n\n00:04:51:\n\nDEVONthink allows me to do that.\n\n00:04:54:\n\nIt does its job really well.\n\n00:04:58:\n\nAnd the thing that makes it different from, you know, another power tool that I use Drafts or Evernote or again, like a Notion or Rome Research kind of tool is that one.\n\n00:05:15:\n\nIt beats all the cloud tools because it's designed to work with my local machine.\n\n00:05:21:\n\nSo adding some order to my chaotic system.\n\n00:05:26:\n\nThe other thing that it does is it make some connections and allows me to easily connect things that should be connected.\n\n00:05:39:\n\nAnd it allows me to look at different things from many different schools of thought, which isn't always the best way to do things.\n\n00:05:54:\n\nBut when you need to, it is amazing.\n\n00:06:01:\n\nSo again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this.\n\n00:06:03:\n\nIf you've been looking at DEVONthink you'd know all the stuff that I could talk about with it?\n\n00:06:09:\n\nUm, if you aren't looking into DEVONthink unless you just genuinely have a problem with maintaining lots and lots of files and documents and things like that over a long period of time.\n\n00:06:22:\n\nOr you're just fed up with Evernote as a whole and its inability to, um, not move like a giant green elephant in a china shop, you know, then I mean, give it a try.\n\n00:06:37:\n\nThere's a free trial.\n\n00:06:38:\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n00:06:39:\n\nI mean, if you really want to talk about it, they have a forum.\n\n00:06:42:\n\nThey have, um a lot of people that air again, much more avid users shout out to the Nested Folders podcast.\n\n00:06:50:\n\nThey did a great to show seriess on how they both use. DEVONthink in their own systems.\n\n00:06:59:\n\nOne, uh, uses it more of, ah, file cabinet, the other one more of ah ah, thought companion.\n\n00:07:10:\n\nBut there's an app that I wanted to talk about a little bit from the business side, and this is after I haven't used a hun.\n\n00:07:23:\n\nBut I've used it.\n\n00:07:25:\n\nAnd when I have used it, it has had a really good effect.\n\n00:07:30:\n\nUh, I used to do business meetings any type of any time I was doing, like a client consultation.\n\n00:07:36:\n\nI would use something like notion.\n\n00:07:39:\n\nUm, I'm a firm believer in the idea of shared notes are better when you're able to collaborate on them.\n\n00:07:50:\n\nThe one problem that I had with notion initially was that you know, you get us up in account, you got to give them access, they can watch, you do stuff, and that's cool.\n\n00:07:59:\n\nBut ultimately, it doesn't feel as inviting for someone that's not a part of your team to come in and start working with you.\n\n00:08:07:\n\nAnd there was also, like the pricing question and things like that.\n\n00:08:10:\n\nBut for the last couple of consultations that I've had, I have used a tool called Miro. MIRO is an interesting little tool.\n\n00:08:22:\n\nIt is basically a collaborative white board, and it's designed to be a collaborative white board. One of the things I like about is that it also gives you a section for your notes. It allows you to attach things. It allows you to collect a bunch of stuff under one umbrella.\n\n00:08:38:\n\nI mean, imagine having a giant whiteboard and being able to just have everybody writing on it and asking questions and commenting and doing things like that.\n\n00:08:49:\n\nI really like it, Um, especially for like a consultation type thing.\n\n00:08:57:\n\nI haven't used it at the premium level where they have stuff like of voice and video chat and stuff like that.\n\n00:09:06:\n\nI mean, just you zoom.\n\n00:09:08:\n\nOr I think in my last consultation call, I like, I think we just use facetime and then, as we were talking, you know, we're both adding stuff into it so that's cool by itself.\n\n00:09:21:\n\nBut yeah, I mean, again, just this isn't an attempt to get people to try stuff.\n\n00:09:27:\n\nIt's more of Ah, hey, here's something that if you haven't heard about it and it's something that it suits you, then sure, why not take a crack at it?\n\n00:09:34:\n\nIt's not gonna be life changing for someone unless it is the exact thing that they're looking for.\n\n00:09:42:\n\nSo we've talked a little bit about the productivity side of things.\n\n00:09:47:\n\nLet's jump into the projects.\n\n00:09:51:\n\nAh, but to do nothings really changed much on the project side of life.\n\n00:09:55:\n\nI mean, it is it's still basically render engine and transcript.\n\n00:09:59:\n\nOr for me, I do believe the last time we had a conversation like this transcriptor was still just a Django app now it is no longer Django app.\n\n00:10:09:\n\nIt is a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/transcriptor/).\n\n00:10:13:\n\nYes, but he s the best way to put it.\n\n00:10:16:\n\nAt the end of the day, I realized that I don't want to build a SaaS app.\n\n00:10:21:\n\nI know that there are a bunch of people out there.\n\n00:10:23:\n\nThey're like, \"Oh, yeah, SaaS applications!\"\n\n00:10:25:\n\n\"That's passive income and smart revenue.\"\n\n00:10:28:\n\nAnd there's a whole conversation to have about that.\n\n00:10:31:\n\nBut that is not me.\n\n00:10:33:\n\nWhat I enjoy doing more than anything is helping people directly by me providing a service to them.\n\n00:10:41:\n\nNow I know that's not scalable.\n\n00:10:43:\n\nI understand that.\n\n00:10:45:\n\nI don't care.\n\n00:10:46:\n\nUm, there's a excellent book that I've been reading on and off, you know, for the last who knows how long.\n\n00:10:52:\n\nCalled _Company of One__ by Paul Jarvis.\n\n00:10:55:\n\nI think that there is an amazing idea and an amazing benefit to imposing a limit of scalability on yourself and on your company.\n\n00:11:09:\n\nAnd here's Here's what I mean, if I use pit transcriptor, as you know, we'll pick transcript of the Django app.\n\n00:11:17:\n\nIt's a great tool that allows anybody to sign up for an account and start doing transcriptions and Ultimately, I'm eating the cost, which means I'm having to charge people memberships, which means I am now in the business of customer service.\n\n00:11:31:\n\nI'm in the business of tech support, and I am in the business of having to explain to people why Amazon transcribe does some of the things that it does because of how it does it.\n\n00:11:44:\n\nAnd there are a lot of different things that Amazon transcribe Google Cloud Platform or Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\n00:11:54:\n\nAll of these services do certain things because they have to in order to scale at the level that they want to scale.\n\n00:12:03:\n\nBut what's the alternative here?\n\n00:12:07:\n\nI could build a system that allows me personally to do transcriptions at a rate that I can afford in that I could maintain and by providing it as a python package.\n\n00:12:22:\n\nThere is a level of support that I'm willing to give, but a lot of that is I can now define the scope of the application of the package that I'm supporting.\n\n00:12:37:\n\nIf I decide that the transcript or packages on Lee going to support AWS Transcribe, then okay, I have the ability to do that if I decide that transcriptor is not going to support custom vocabulary.\n\n00:13:03:\n\nI can do that if I and these are all things that I have chosen to do.\n\n00:13:13:\n\nIf I decide that transcript is only going to focus on the resulted output of a transcription job and not the actual processing of the job itself, I conduce that.\n\n00:13:29:\n\nAnd by doing that, I narrow the scope that I am responsible for to my clients.\n\n00:13:38:\n\nI'm Onley responsible for the actual job that they're paying me to do.\n\n00:13:47:\n\nThey're not paying me to maintain a python packages or maintaining Meteo or they're paying me too.\n\n00:13:52:\n\nProvide them with a transcription.\n\n00:13:57:\n\nAnd the developers that are using the tool that I have built are I mean, they're not paying me at all, but they're relying on me, too.\n\n00:14:10:\n\nProvide a level of knowledge and service about the platform, or about the system that I have created all while while having the ability to take it and make it their own because it is an open source.\n\n00:14:25:\n\nA pack same thing with render engine render engine by default as a static side generator is designed to be very flexible, but because I'm not selling static sites is a service.\n\n00:14:45:\n\nI'm only providing a system for generating sites.\n\n00:14:52:\n\nThat is a level of insight that I don't have to provide.\n\n00:14:56:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper SEO.\n\n00:14:59:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper CDN usage and compression of images and things like that.\n\n00:15:05:\n\nMy system does not care about these things.\n\n00:15:09:\n\nIt does not benefit them anyway.\n\n00:15:11:\n\nThe only way that we were able to integrate sire like a search capability, like for those who don't know, one of the big achievements of he had this year for render engine is the integration in with a fuse dot Js, which is a static site search.\n\n00:15:30:\n\nUm, that's all done on the client side.\n\n00:15:34:\n\nBasically, you supply a JavaScript package with a JSON Output and you can search that file poor content.\n\n00:15:46:\n\nNow they're probably better ways to do it.\n\n00:15:50:\n\nI'm sure you could offload that to another service, but my assumption is if you're building static sites, you have a certain thought about offloading stuff to third party service.\n\n00:16:07:\n\nUm, but, you know, part of my thought pattern was Do I want to support looter?\n\n00:16:14:\n\nAnother static site search engine do I want to support, um, elastic search and do I want to support?\n\n00:16:23:\n\nYou know, Al Gore, Uh, or out was What is it?\n\n00:16:28:\n\nYeah, Al Gore as either Algora or Algoria.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nSomething like that.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nI think it's Algora.\n\n00:16:33:\n\nAnd because I wasn't saying, \"Hey, everybody, here's a platform that, you know, you give me $10 a month and I host your static site.\"\n\n00:16:45:\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with people that are doing that.\n\n00:16:47:\n\nYou know, shout out to the whole micro.blog service and Manton Reese and Jene McDonald and the other people that are a part of making that a reality.\n\n00:16:56:\n\nUm, that's just not me.\n\n00:16:58:\n\nThat's just not what I'm aiming to do.\n\n00:17:01:\n\nI would much rather make sure stuff that I'm doing is compatible with what they're doing.\n\n00:17:06:\n\nAnd they have really made that easy.\n\n00:17:07:\n\nSo again, big shout out to them.\n\n00:17:12:\n\nSo I guess in this rambling that is kind of my big take away in this whole conversation is there's something to say about the idea of controlling the scope of your projects, and that is something that I am learning more and more of as I get older and as I want to do more things while having more responsibilities is, I have to be able to control the scope of what I'm doing.\n\n00:17:50:\n\nSo the big pit question for you that I want to hear about, whether it's on Twitter or whether you want to email me at info it productivity in tech dot com is how are you controlling the scope of the things that you're doing?\n\n00:18:13:\n\nAnd furthermore, what can you do in order to begin controlling the scope of some things that might have gotten out of control?\n\n00:18:30:\n\nI'm gonna leave it there because the last, you know, five minutes or so of this little podcast thing, it's going to be devoted to a little bit of, ah administration work here.\n\n00:18:45:\n\nSo I've been thinking more and more about Pitt as a community, as a group of people Maurin Mawr during this time with racial injustice and things like that happening.\n\n00:19:04:\n\nHave I not been more proud of the black community that I've been a part of, you know, obviously from birth, but also the vocal community and the amount of ally ship that I have around me and that has made me want to value the people within that community.\n\n00:19:29:\n\nMore and more now, I'm still not sure how that involves pit, but what I have learned is that I want to be able to support of the things and the people that are doing amazing things more and more.\n\n00:19:50:\n\nAnd by doing that, I have to have the support of the community.\n\n00:19:55:\n\nSo here is my I thought I would be willing toe have more conversations like this on a regular basis if there were some form of feedback one, there has to be feedback on it.\n\n00:20:23:\n\nI don't I don't mind shouting into the either, but the actual time it takes tow, edit and record this.\n\n00:20:29:\n\nAnd I mean, even the editing isn't much, but I cough a lot.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm an asthmatic.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm a chronic asthmatic.\n\n00:20:34:\n\nThere's a lot of coughing that's involved in a lot of people.\n\n00:20:36:\n\nSometimes here and then sometimes don't hear, depending on my mood.\n\n00:20:43:\n\nOne.\n\n00:20:44:\n\nThere's got to be feedback in the term and in actual like conversation.\n\n00:20:51:\n\nI'm only sharing this stuff with you because I want to start a conversation.\n\n00:20:58:\n\nIf there's no desire for a conversation to be had then I have no reason to continues speaking about it.\n\n00:21:10:\n\nThe other side is it has to make sense from a time value perspective.\n\n00:21:18:\n\nAs some may noticed, I have upped the transparency of me searching for, um, I want to say a job, but searching for a way to provide for my family?\n\n00:21:33:\n\nNo, I have a job.\n\n00:21:36:\n\nI'm not worried about getting fired today, at least, and pit is still growing.\n\n00:21:43:\n\nI mean, last year was the best year for pit, which I mean.\n\n00:21:47:\n\nLuckily, the company's only two years old, so you know, hopefully, hopefully we can continue moving in a positive direction.\n\n00:21:58:\n\nBut the time that it takes to record this I'm currently sitting at 22 minutes, 39 seconds.\n\n00:22:05:\n\nI think on the actual recording, it's like 22 minutes, five seconds, something like that.\n\n00:22:10:\n\nBut I was working on a transcription before I started doing this, and I said, You know what?\n\n00:22:16:\n\nI really need to get that thing done.\n\n00:22:17:\n\nSo if I'm going to do more things like that, I need to make sure that I'm not taking away time from my family without it making sense from a from a value perspective.\n\n00:22:37:\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\n00:22:41:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be a patri on?\n\n00:22:42:\n\nNo.\n\n00:22:43:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be ah member full or something like that?\n\n00:22:47:\n\nNo, I don't know what it means at the moment.\n\n00:22:51:\n\nWhat I'm looking for is one person.\n\n00:22:56:\n\nI'm looking for a couple things.\n\n00:22:57:\n\nI'm looking for two people to listen to this and tell me that they heard it.\n\n00:23:02:\n\nThey enjoyed it or they heard it and they didn't enjoy it.\n\n00:23:05:\n\nAnd here's why.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nOr they heard it.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nAnd I'm an idiot or whatever.\n\n00:23:09:\n\nThe other thing I want to hear is someone say I have heard this.\n\n00:23:13:\n\nI appreciate it.\n\n00:23:15:\n\nIt brought me value.\n\n00:23:17:\n\nAnd I want to, in some way, shape or form compensate you for the value that you've put out.\n\n00:23:27:\n\nNow, if you feel like you can't afford that, by all means, I understand I'm not even saying that you have to feel obligated to give me money.\n\n00:23:39:\n\nI am saying that if this truly brings value to you and you feel like you would be willing to do something to ensure that this value continued to happen, I need to know, because otherwise all I'm doing is wasting my time and my energy putting something out there that no one's listening to now, the pit podcast as a whole.\n\n00:24:07:\n\nThe interviews they will still happen because I enjoy.\n\n00:24:09:\n\nI enjoy the conversations.\n\n00:24:12:\n\nAt the present time, I have five six interviews scheduled in like the next month.\n\n00:24:24:\n\nI can stretch those out for the remainder of the year, and that will be the entire pit season.\n\n00:24:30:\n\nOr I can release them on a bi weekly, maybe even weekly basis, like we used to back in the good old days.\n\n00:24:40:\n\nBut I'm not going to do that at the stake of my sanity, knowing that it's not going to make an impact in anyone's life or knowing that the people who are consuming it are just using.\n\n00:24:54:\n\nIt is background noise.\n\n00:24:55:\n\nI cannot do that.\n\n00:24:57:\n\nSo here's the promise that I'm making today as I'm recording this and this will be released is June 10th.\n\n00:25:05:\n\nIf by June 20th we have one pledge to somehow pay for this service, you know, pay for this podcast, not even not even monetarily.\n\n00:25:21:\n\nMaybe it's just in terms of like, Hey, I promise that if you put in episode, I will retweet it and I will reply with a comment.\n\n00:25:30:\n\nI am okay with that being the currency.\n\n00:25:33:\n\nI love your money.\n\n00:25:34:\n\nBut if you don't have it, I understand.\n\n00:25:37:\n\nSome of us just don't have it.\n\n00:25:40:\n\nAnd if I have two people that can just say Hey, you know what?\n\n00:25:44:\n\nI really enjoyed the conversation.\n\n00:25:45:\n\nI really enjoyed the thought piece.\n\n00:25:47:\n\nThis is what I did like.\n\n00:25:48:\n\nThis is what I didn't like.\n\n00:25:49:\n\nMaybe a little too much preaching at the end.\n\n00:25:53:\n\nWhatever it is.\n\n00:25:55:\n\n10 days.\n\n00:25:57:\n\nI will talk about this every single day.\n\n00:25:59:\n\nI will tweet it out every single day.\n\n00:26:01:\n\nI will give it my full up.\n\n00:26:03:\n\nDo a transcription for it.\n\n00:26:05:\n\nI will do everything possible to make sure that people hear this.\n\n00:26:13:\n\nAnd if again, two people tell me, Give me some feedback.\n\n00:26:19:\n\nOne person pledges some type of either money or effort in terms of a currency.\n\n00:26:27:\n\nThen I will continue to do this and I will pledge to release the episodes that I'm recording at a bi weekly basis.\n\n00:26:33:\n\nStarting out if we get more than that and I feel like I can truly start doing this on a weekly basis, then by all means, that's awesome.\n\n00:26:40:\n\nBut if not, I have to think about the effort that I'm putting in, and I have to think about the find that it's taking away from my family and things like that.\n\n00:26:54:\n\nI have no problem with it.\n\n00:26:55:\n\nMy family has no problem with it, but ultimately we and by we I mean me.\n\n00:27:02:\n\nI I want to share this content with you, but I don't want it to fall on deaf ears, and I don't want it to just be background noise for someone's commute.\n\n00:27:12:\n\nI want to be something that they take in and that they value.\n\n00:27:15:\n\nSo that's my pledge to you.\n\n00:27:16:\n\nLike I said, two pieces of feedback.\n\n00:27:18:\n\nOne pledge.\n\n00:27:19:\n\nIf you can make that happen, then the podcasts interviews will go on a biweekly schedule, and I will probably supplement the interviews with more thoughts like this, just less preachiness on the back end.\n\n00:27:31:\n\nBut that's gonna do it for this week.\n\n00:27:33:\n\nI have been your, um, speaker and your hose J.\n\n00:27:39:\n\nMiller.\n\n00:27:39:\n\nIf you want to reach out to me, there's a couple ways you can do it.\n\n00:27:43:\n\nYou can A) hit me up on Twitter.\n\n00:27:45:\n\nI'm [@kjaymiller](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller).\n\n00:27:48:\n\nYou can B) email me at info at productivityintech dot com, or C) You could go to my website [kjaymiller.com](https://kjaymiller.com).\n\n00:27:57:\n\nUh, there might be a contact button there.\n\n00:28:00:\n\nThere might not be?\n\n00:28:01:\n\nNo, actually.\n\n00:28:02:\n\nNow, you can't really do that when there's no contact button.\n\n00:28:04:\n\nI'm also a microdot.\n\n00:28:05:\n\nBlawg at KJ.\n\n00:28:07:\n\nWhy Miller, if you use microdot block instead of Twitter.\n\n00:28:10:\n\nBut if you want to be invited into our privates like channel, I'll bet you.\n\n00:28:15:\n\nBut if I like, If I like the cut of your jib, then sure, we'll bring you in.\n\n00:28:21:\n\nUm, once we have enough, people will start an open conversation about how we can make this work financially.\n\n00:28:31:\n\nI'm open to doing more things like this, whether they're a live stream, whether we're having, like, voice, call, conversation, stuff or whatever.\n\n00:28:40:\n\nBut more than anything, I just want to make sure that people are hearing this and that people are getting something out of it.\n\n00:28:46:\n\nBut that's gonna do it for this time.\n\n00:28:49:\n\nI'm Jay Miller.\n\n00:28:49:\n\nThank you so much for listening.\n\n00:28:52:\n\nUh, thank you to Nadir Omowale for the use of his music a \"hustler in spite of myself\" for the intro and outro music.\n\n00:28:59:\n\nAnd of course, I hope for the last 29 minutes and five seconds that we have been productive.\n\n00:29:06:\n\nThank you so much.\n\n00:29:08:\n\nI will talk to you next time.", "title": "[PIT Podcast] Getting Real and Narrowing Scope",

about several _lifestyle_ schools of thought. Many people devote to the GTD way of life, while others, like myself, have decided to reduce the number of technological dependencies in favor of a more analog lifestyle.\n\n## The Mindfulness Movement\n\nMindfulness is a growing trend in personal productivity. Many productivity YouTubers present a very worry-free lifestyle that talks about mastering languages and giving themselves personal challenges to make the question habits and vices. The success of the genre itself speaks to the power of and intrigue from others that comes from the idea that you can live a life that above all things centers on understanding and challenging the things that you are doing at any given time.\n\n\n## What is a Multipotentialite?\n\nRenown author and speaker on the subject, Emilie Wapnik defines on [her site][puttylike]:\n\n> A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.\n>\n> It stems from the word \"multipotentiality\" \u2013 a psychological and educational term used to describe people who display aptitudes across multiple disciplines.\n\nSimply put, it's not just about doing a lot, but it's doing a lot with a higher degree of skill in each venture.\n\nI've defined myself as a _multipotentialite_ for the last 3 years. My passions are in podcasting, development, and community engagement.\n\n\n## Can These Worlds Collide and _Should_ They?\n\nHaving defined these two areas, I begin to wonder if it is possible to even claim to both live a life that challenges each action and embrace the chaos and unique challenges of weaving in and out of passions.\n\n![person holding skulpture](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/creative-female-artist-with-painted-vase-in-modern-studio-3817583.jpg)\n\nThe more important question, in my opinion, is not if we can, but more if we should?[^3]\n\nMy answer to this challenge would be \"to a certain degree\". I do believe that there is value in uncertainty and rigidity is often the enemy of creativity[^2]. But I also think there is something to gain from strategically putting yourself in a position to let your creativity flourish.\n\n## Making Room for Your Hats\n\nThis topic of thought probably belongs in a blog post called \"Multipotentiality vs Minimalism\" which is something that I considered writing and but I'm not the most versed on minimalism (by choice), so I don't feel comfortable speaking on it with any level of expertise.\n\nOne of the biggest areas of _Mindfulness_ is questioning the value and ultimately choosing to not do something. When you are a multipotentialite, you often tend to naturally collect a lot of things, as you are doing more. To make room, you may need to remove a few things both physically and mentally. \n\nOur interests change over time. A multipotentialite's superpower is the ability to push their passions (however many there are) as far as possible given their constraints. By removing many of the constraints we maximize the time and energy that we can devote to the things that matter to us.\n\nIn some ways, this can be changing your job to one that better aligns with your current fascinations, or dialing back the amount of time we spend on one, less meaningful hobby to focus more time and energy on more impactful endeavors.\n\nOn the physical side, I can keep this one brief. By removing the things that aren't as important to you, you now can showcase the more valuable things. That's it. That's the tweet.\n\n## Thinking about How to Live Your Best MultiPotential Life\n\nPart of the Mindfulness mentality that often gets ignored is the idea of choosing the things that you will do.\n\n![Person with computer with paints in foreground](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/photo-of-a-woman-thinking-941555.jpg)\n\nThere is a subset of _multipods_, that aren't doing many different things **at once**. Many people don't consider themselves multipotentialites because they hung up their ice skates, electric guitar, and sculpting tools long ago. For many embracing the lifestyle, they can create new opportunities in old passions by finding new ways to participate. Today there are new mediums to engage in a passion and countless possibilities to work in and around an industry.\n\nFor me, this means connecting with developers on Twitter and inviting them onto the [Productivity in Tech Podcast] to learn more about the awesome things they are doing (Podcasting and Community Engagement). When I hear of something new, I play around with it on my stream. Often they ask me about podcasting and live-streaming and that leads to doing consultancy and editing work. Then to help reduce the amount of work that I'm doing at any time, I create tools to help those same creators.\n\n---\n\nAt the heart of multipotentiality, there is a need for flexibility. At the heart of mindfulness, there is a need for a lack of rigidity. \ud83e\udd14 It seems like the core fundamentals of these two ways of living are the same.\n\n[^1]: Many of those friends would consider me a part of the productivity space as well. I wouldn't disagree \ud83d\ude1c\n\n[^2]: I wanted to find an inspiring quote about creativity but after about 5 minutes of looking for verified quotes from people that are known across \n\n[^3]: Probably one of the best quotes of my generation. I wish I could use more. Of course the real question...Almost did it again. \n\n[^4]: Photo by [Andrea Piacquadio](https://www.pexels.com/@olly) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-a-woman-thinking-941555/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels)\n\n[puttylike]: https://puttylike.com/terminology/\n[Productivity in Tech Podcast]: https://podcast.productivityintech.com", "title": "Multipotentiality vs Mindfulness", "category": "Productivity", "tags": "['multipotentiality', 'mindfulness']", "date": "2020-07-23T17:08:00-07:00", "image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kjaymiller/images/photo-of-a-woman-thinking-941555.jpg", "slug": "multipotentiality-vs-mindfulness", "url": "/multipotentiality-vs-mindfulness", "date_published": "Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:08:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Jul 23, 2020 17:08 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"base_content": "I wanted to write this to show that the easiest answer can often elude us. \n\nIf I asked you to add a twitch frame to a website and make it only appear when you were live, how would you do it?\n\n## Embedding the Twitch Frame\n\nFollowing the [documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything) from Twitch, I copied the example code, adjusted the width and the height[^1], and changed the `channel-id` to my Twitch username.\n\n## Checking the Live Status\n\nAfter spending an hour on stream trying to build a twitch app, I opted for the more low-tech solution. \n\n```javascript\nif (player.getPlayerState().currentTime != 0) {\n    document.querySelector('#twitch-block').style.display = 'initial';\n  }\n\n  else {\n    document.querySelector('#twitch-block').style.display=\"None\";\n  }\n```\n\nThere were a few reasons:\n\n- The javascript was easy.\n- The authentication stuff is hard to stream (in a secure way)\n- RateLimits and things\n- THE JAVASCRIPT WAS EASY\n\nThe hardest part about building this listener was keeping it simple. You could add event listeners and things and you could use webhooks and all that stuff. Another option is to look at the `currentTime` value. When you are not streaming, `player.getPlayerState().currentTime == 0`[^2]. This means that I can set  `display=\"None\"` on the element that holds the twitch player. Allowing my website to act like the embed was never there[^3]. \n\nDon't forget to add an amazing purple background so it looks fantastic!\n\n![embed with a beautiful background](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/purple-background-twitch-embed.png)\n\n[^1]: Which I still a little confused on how that present in a responsive way\n[^2]: I don't know if this is the case if you are hosting someone sooooo...

To me this was a return to my _Midori Traveller's Notebook_ and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. \n\nWith January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. \n\n### What went well\nSince I've been reading [_The Bullet Journal Method_][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. \n\nThis time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in _Marie Kondo_ style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were \"essential\" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. \n\nWith the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.\n\nAnother big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  \n\n### What didn't go so well\nThere is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. \n\nAnother failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. \n\n### My thoughts going into February\nFebruary is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.", "title": "January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap", "date": "2019-02-01T16:00:00-08:00", "category": "Analog", "tags": "['bullet journal', 'reflection']", "slug": "january-2019-bullet-journal-recap", "url": "/january-2019-bullet-journal-recap", "date_published": "Fri, 01 Feb 2019 16:00:00 -0800", "date_friendly": "Feb 01, 2019 16:00 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"base_content": "> _Stay in Your Lane._ - NRA to Emergency Room Doctors\n\n\n> _Shut up and Dribble._ - Laura Ingraham\n\n\n> _Why does every black actor gotta rap some.

I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.\n\nFor many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.\n\nFor me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college.

White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.\n\nThat's it.\n\nMy thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these \"Dangerous\" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years\n\n### How Do You Fix Number 2?\n\nMake education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.\n\nAs someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.\n\nMy chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.\n\nI will put it clearly...\n\n**HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.**\n\nIt won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).\n\n> \"_We can't pull ourselves up by our bootstraps if we can't afford boots._\" - Someone that at one point couldn't afford boots.", "title": "How Can White People Help Black People.

Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. \n\nI've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.\n\nThis Month, I purchased [DevonThink](https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink). I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other [DevonTechnologies](https://devontechnologies.com) Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.\n\n![DevonThink](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/CleanShot-2020-05-25-at-23.34.03.png)\n\n## Posts\n\n- [Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks](https://kjaymiller.com/quick_productivity_tip_-_walk_and_talks)\n- [Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda](https://kjaymiller.com/qtp-family-agenda)\n\n## Projects\n\n### Render Engine \n* Made a few changes to clean up URL's.

Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. \n\n### Episde-DL\n\n[Episode-DL](https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/) is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.\n\n### Following Me\nYou can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website.

This is a look at the first steps of me automating my Github Profile.\n\n### Step 1: Rename the repo my website to a repo named after my GitHub username\n\nThis is easy enough. Just rename the repo (in Github) to your username.\nRemember this has to be exact and it is case-sensitive.\n\nYou can do this in the settings menu of your repo. You don't have to change the\ndirectory names or anything like that on a local machine. (I'm not sure if you\nare using a Git Client other than the cli).\n\n### Step 2: Create a copy of your existing readme as a template\n\nMy goal was to create my README using a Jinja2 and Github Actions. For that I\nwould need a template to render. So since most of the data was the same I just\ncopied my existing README.\n\n### Step 3: Add Dynamic Content using Jinja2 Variables\n\n\nStarting out I wanted to show my latest blog post and my latest podcast episode\nfrom [Productivity in Tech Podcast](https://podcast.productivityiintech.com). We will create a python script that does\nthis, but we needed to add the variables that Jinja2 would use for the dynamic\ndata.\n\nYou could do something like a search and replace, but I feel like just\nrendering a template is much easier to edit and understand. Also, the compute\ntime for Github Actions is free and this doesn't need to be the most\nperformance conscious program. Also I like Jinja2, so there is also that \ud83d\ude43.\n\n```markdown\n# From README_template.md\n\nYou can see what he's posting about at <https://kjaymiller.com>.\n\n**Latest Post - [{{latest_post.title}}]({{latest_post.link}})**\n\n**Latest Productivity in Tech Podcast Episode - [{{latest_podcast_post.title}}]({{latest_podcast_post.link}})**\n\n## Active Projects\n```\n\n### Step 4: Build your script to get the data and write the up to date README.md\n\nThis script is pretty simple once you know what you're looking for. I'm using\nthe feedparser plugin to parse the rss feeds and then returning the title and\nlink for the latest episode.\n\n```python\ndef get_latest_post(rss_feed):\n    f = feedparser.parse(rss_feed)\n    latest_post = sorted(f['entries'], key=lambda x:x['published_parsed'])[-1]\n    return {\n            'title': latest_post['title'],\n            'link': latest_post['link'],\n            }\n```\n\nThen you set the template to the text of your template file.\n then write the rendered text to your README.\n\n```python\n# update readme\ntemplate = Template(Path('./README_template.md').read_text())\nPath('./README.md').write_text(\n        template.render(\n            latest_post=get_latest_post(rss_feed),\n            latest_podcast_post=get_latest_post(podcast_url),\n            )\n        )\n```\n\n## Step 5: Setup your Github Actions File\n\nI'm not the best at Github Actions. Luckily for me, this action was super\nsimple to setup. \n\nYou can look at the [.yml file](https://github.com/kjaymiller/kjaymiller/blob/master/.github/workflows/latest_post_readme.yml) I'm not going to talk about the setup of this\nbecause most of it is prep stuff. Here's the important bit.\n\n```yaml\n# in steps:\n- name: Install Feedparser & Jinja2\n  run: pip install feedparser jinja2\n\n- name: Update Readme\n  run: python ./.github/actions/update_readme.py\n```\n\nBasically it's installing the things I need and then running the script (I\nsaved the script in that folder, but you don't really have to as long as its in\nyour repo).\n\nAfter that, you add some commands to update your repo and you're off to the\nraces.\n\nI have mine setup to update on a github push in that repo, but in the future I\nwill probably setup the file on a schedule to also update when I push something\nnew (Future Post...Probably).\n\n[Productivity in Tech Podcast]: https://podcast.productivityintech.com", "title": "How I AutoUpdate

August.\n\n00:00:32:\n\n Oh, boy, it has been quite a month.\n\n00:00:36:\n\n Quite quite quite a month, I guess.\n\n00:00:43:\n\n Technically, it hasn't been quite a month because it's only been a few days in, but July was busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy and we're gonna get into that.\n\n00:00:54:\n\n But we're also gonna be talking about some of the other things going on around the world of pit in my world, in all of the things that I've been noticing, a little bit of news and some other stuff.\n\n00:01:13:\n\n So let's let's jump right in.\n\n00:01:17:\n\n Let's catch up here.\n\n00:01:19:\n\n The how is July for me shall I was busy, so I was, like, stupid busy.\n\n00:01:26:\n\n Ah, I did a lot of things.\n\n00:01:27:\n\n In July, I gave a couple of talks, one for the Mac Stock Expo in which I talked about playing for profit, which basically was the idea of creating Elaine for yourself by having fun and then being able to financially sustain yourself from that lane that you've created.\n\n00:01:58:\n\n I also gave a talk.\n\n00:02:01:\n\n Ah, local meet up at San Diego Python call the Working with files and high test Um, I There's a huge bag story behind that.\n\n00:02:12:\n\n But long story short, I thought that the pie test testing framework worked one way in a certain area.\n\n00:02:25:\n\n But turns out it doesn't.\n\n00:02:27:\n\n And I did a little deep dive into that and then basically revealed my findings in about a 12 minute talk.\n\n00:02:37:\n\n But what else did we dio?\n\n00:02:39:\n\n We guest on a couple of shows.\n\n00:02:44:\n\n Um, neither one of them are out yet.\n\n00:02:46:\n\n So your ears peeled in your eyes, appealed for you know those announcements, I will share that information on my website, as well as on Twitter and microdot blawg whenever things go live.\n\n00:03:06:\n\n But, yeah, I had a blast talking with the hosts, and I don't get to be on other shows very often.\n\n00:03:17:\n\n So when I am, I'm, like, super pumped on.\n\n00:03:21:\n\n If I remember correctly, I don't remember the first.\n\n00:03:25:\n\n But when I did the first interview, I'm pretty sure it was either in late June or early early July.\n\n00:03:35:\n\n So I may have done three guest appearances this past month, which is just a lot for me.\n\n00:03:49:\n\n No, something that I was wondering whether or not I should talk about publicly, but ultimately decided that I will, because I think it's important.\n\n00:04:09:\n\n But I took a few interviews this month, and what does that look like?\n\n00:04:17:\n\n Oh, boy, I will say, for one.\n\n00:04:21:\n\n The interview process for software engineering or software development or developer advocacy.\n\n00:04:29:\n\n All those things.\n\n00:04:31:\n\n The process is a very, very long, then tiring, especially if you're already employed.\n\n00:04:42:\n\n I am fortunate to be in a position to where I can take an interview and kind of not worry as much because I am act, you know, actively employed.\n\n00:04:58:\n\n I think that more than anything, employers want to see what you have to offer, not on paper buds out loud.\n\n00:05:21:\n\n And I could talk about this as a deep dive and say, like, Oh, hey, you want to be practicing out out?\n\n00:05:28:\n\n I think that there's a lot of value in that.\n\n00:05:30:\n\n I think there's a lot of value and letting people see the process.\n\n00:05:33:\n\n In fact, that's why they do coding like coating interviews like the coding challenge stuff where they say, Oh, hey, we want you to solve this problem.\n\n00:05:42:\n\n But remember, it's more about how you solve the problem.\n\n00:05:45:\n\n Not necessarily that you solve the problem like they want to see the process.\n\n00:05:50:\n\n They don't want to necessarily just see a solution.\n\n00:05:53:\n\n So that said, I feel very fortunate because people approach to me based on the things that I was already doing.\n\n00:06:07:\n\n So it became Hey, we see what you're doing.\n\n00:06:11:\n\n Do you want to do that thing for our company instead of Hey, I see you're you're looking for work.\n\n00:06:19:\n\n Can you explain to me why you would be a good fit?\n\n00:06:22:\n\n It was like here.\n\n00:06:23:\n\n We already know you would be a good fit.\n\n00:06:25:\n\n Or at least we have a really good idea that you would be a good fit.\n\n00:06:28:\n\n So how do we go through this song and dance of the recruiting process to one.\n\n00:06:35:\n\n Verify that.\n\n00:06:36:\n\n Verify that.\n\n00:06:37:\n\n You know, this stuff that you're doing on a regular isn't just some flu gets.\n\n00:06:41:\n\n It's something that you're able to do.\n\n00:06:42:\n\n It's gonna be something that's able to be translated into the job.\n\n00:06:51:\n\n But the only way I was able to have those conversations was by practicing out loud by having these conversations with virtually myself and sharing it out with the world for whoever would decide to listen.\n\n00:07:06:\n\n And that's what one of the things that I talked about in my Mac stock talk was, even if you know that it isn't the best, even if you know that there aren't a ton of people watching, treat it like a Children's recital.\n\n00:07:26:\n\n Allow yourself to look a little goofy, allow yourself toe, learn from those around you and take that information and publicly improve because people want to work with people who have the ability to improve.\n\n00:07:44:\n\n And just because you couldn't do a thing now doesn't mean that you won't always be able to do that.\n\n00:07:51:\n\n You'll be able to do that thing eventually, with enough working and maybe a little bit of advice, a little bit of documentation reading, you'll be able to figure it out.\n\n00:08:00:\n\n In fact, that's one of the things about streaming at night, which is something we will talk about in a second.\n\n00:08:05:\n\n That has been kind of a challenge for me because I struggle to learn new things when I'm tired, like most people.\n\n00:08:17:\n\n So if I've worked, you know, full shift.\n\n00:08:24:\n\n If I worked a full shift and then all of a sudden I am also now streaming and trying to perform and trying to learn all of these things at the same time.\n\n00:08:38:\n\n Then I often struggle with the ability to do that when usually I wind up going to bed, not having solved the issue, waking up and then solving it within the first couple of hours in the day.\n\n00:08:54:\n\n So there's something to say about.\n\n00:08:55:\n\n I probably could even just flip my streams, wake up early and do like super early warning streams when I'm like first waking up, get some coffee and me and I'm ready to go.\n\n00:09:06:\n\n But I don't see that working out for my sleep schedule as well as I don't see my family appreciating that very much because, you know, we have these hardwood floors.\n\n00:09:17:\n\n It's an older house, they creek.\n\n00:09:19:\n\n I would have basically be waking up everyone, and that's never good.\n\n00:09:26:\n\n But all that to say the interview process still has its quirks.\n\n00:09:38:\n\n I will say that I have been lucky in that I have had people on my team promoting the crap out of me, saying like, Hey, you know this person is an amazing developer.\n\n00:09:49:\n\n This prison is an amazing person you should totally higher in like I've had.\n\n00:09:53:\n\n I've had, like, a street team out there working.\n\n00:09:56:\n\n And for those listening that are on that street team, thank you so much.\n\n00:10:00:\n\n Even if I get hired, keep it up.\n\n00:10:01:\n\n Because, I mean, I think that it's one of those things, like the more more people that air, seeing the results, the fruits of our labor, the more and more will be able to not only help me but help others that are in the same position.\n\n00:10:15:\n\n I would love for people to come to me, saying, Oh, hey, by the way, are you looking for a job?\n\n00:10:19:\n\n But I can say no.\n\n00:10:20:\n\n But I know of some people that are looking that would make great hires based on the work that I've seen them put in.\n\n00:10:31:\n\n So yeah, that's it.\n\n00:10:32:\n\n Like I said, I've been going through that process.\n\n00:10:34:\n\n It has been a challenging one, but a rewarding one as well.\n\n00:10:48:\n\n For those that do that have been following me for a long time.\n\n00:10:51:\n\n They know that Ah usually stream heart stone.\n\n00:10:54:\n\n At night.\n\n00:10:55:\n\n I do another podcast called Bob's Tavern Gas, where I I talk about Harston battle grounds with my friend Don.\n\n00:11:03:\n\n And for the past a month, roughly close to a month now we've been streaming.\n\n00:11:13:\n\n I've been streaming coating instead of harsh stone like almost every day, like we're probably 85 90% like almost every week day.\n\n00:11:31:\n\n I think we've only miss like one or two days, and I was because I wasn't feeling well.\n\n00:11:35:\n\n And then on the weekends, even though I normally say I'm not going Teoh, I wind up streaming anyway, so that's been fun.\n\n00:11:43:\n\n If you want to catch me streaming some some python stuff for some react stuff.\n\n00:11:46:\n\n Whenever I jump into that, you can do so on twitch.\n\n00:11:50:\n\n I want to get well at a link to the show notes, and we'll dive into that.\n\n00:11:55:\n\n But streaming is is just I don't know.\n\n00:11:58:\n\n There's something about writing code and having other people be able to see your code like I don't have large audiences on Twitter, anything like that, and I'm not really trying to chase that or like gain a large audience.\n\n00:12:14:\n\n But at the same time, it's great for when I do have a few people in there and I have run into like a mental block.\n\n00:12:26:\n\n Especially like I said, like I'm recording this late at night.\n\n00:12:29:\n\n Normally I would be streaming, but my computer decided to crash, so we decided to give it a little break.\n\n00:12:37:\n\n But when I hit those walls, it's nice tohave someone in the audience to help out ask questions.\n\n00:12:50:\n\n Usually, some of the audience members aren't very familiar with, like summer familiar with what I'm working on, but they're not familiar with the actual code.\n\n00:12:57:\n\n So they're asking questions, and I'm explaining what I'm doing as I'm doing it, which really helps to drive in the why.\n\n00:13:09:\n\n And of course, I always run into the same errors.\n\n00:13:12:\n\n You know, nothing seems air is the same issues that many other developers run into in your writing code, and you're trying to have your having to explain it.\n\n00:13:21:\n\n Sometimes I write code that doesn't need to be written.\n\n00:13:24:\n\n I find myself doing that more than anything of like writing code that wasn't necessary, Onley to catch myself and then wind of deleting all that later and be like, well, that was dumb and moving on.\n\n00:13:45:\n\n But the idea of consistent streaming is something that I've been playing with.\n\n00:13:49:\n\n It's something that if I were to be a dull developer advocate, that's something that I would possibly be interested in doing.\n\n00:14:00:\n\n Maybe not.\n\n00:14:01:\n\n I'm like, not on behalf of the company, but like being like Oh, hey, by the way, I'm a developer advocate.\n\n00:14:05:\n\n I worked for this company, but I'm also a streamer, and we're gonna stream me learning about this thing and do that mostly to bring a little bit of attention to the coup.\n\n00:14:20:\n\n Whatever company I'm working for, it would be cool to be able to build some of the things that I want to build out in public because it's gonna help me learn about whatever company I'm working with or whatever.\n\n00:14:33:\n\n And then it's also going to be a way for me to connect with more and more people in the community, which is always like the job of an advocate.\n\n00:14:45:\n\n See, Like I said, I've been doing podcast interviews have been streaming.\n\n00:14:47:\n\n I've been, ah, interviewing all these things.\n\n00:14:51:\n\n And then somewhere in there, I've been finding time to work on projects.\n\n00:14:55:\n\n So the first half of the month was basically just render engine.\n\n00:15:00:\n\n I was struggling to get sub collections working.\n\n00:15:03:\n\n What was it was something weirdo.\n\n00:15:05:\n\n I remember what it was.\n\n00:15:07:\n\n At first.\n\n00:15:07:\n\n I was trying to get Paige Nation working.\n\n00:15:09:\n\n I had so collections working.\n\n00:15:10:\n\n And then somehow when I made pagination work, I broke sub collections.\n\n00:15:18:\n\n So then I had to go back and redesign that model.\n\n00:15:22:\n\n And at the end of the day, it works.\n\n00:15:24:\n\n I'm happy everybody's happy, and that's cool.\n\n00:15:29:\n\n Then I turned my focus over to transcript er ah, which is definitely the younger of the products.\n\n00:15:38:\n\n To me, it's the more you know, impactful of the products.\n\n00:15:45:\n\n I have people that are actively wanting to use it.\n\n00:15:47:\n\n So that's kind of what I've been shifting my focus over to it more.\n\n00:15:52:\n\n But in doing that, it's been growing really quickly.\n\n00:16:00:\n\n Um, we have basic functionality already done.\n\n00:16:03:\n\n I'm actually working on extending that functionality to support up loading of, uh, audio files to get them transcribed, which is something that a lot of people who I demoed transcript or too like they all thought, Oh yeah, I just use your program for everything.\n\n00:16:17:\n\n It's like no, actually healing used for the second half on, but I have to go through this like wild process of showing them how you do all that stuff.\n\n00:16:25:\n\n But now I could just be like, Oh, yeah, No, you start.\n\n00:16:27:\n\n You load this as an item, you give it a key, and then you tell it, Teoh, upload, start.\n\n00:16:37:\n\n And then later on, you was pulled the data down.\n\n00:16:43:\n\n So now I got to play with the idea.\n\n00:16:48:\n\n And this is where we're going to get into the news because I think this is kind of important, and it's kind of relevant right now.\n\n00:16:56:\n\n So for those that don't know, productivity in Tech is a podcast, a brand in a business.\n\n00:17:07:\n\n The brand is always kind of loose.\n\n00:17:09:\n\n It's like me helping developers create content and all that stuff.\n\n00:17:13:\n\n Um, the podcast is obviously the podcast, and the brand is kind of my personal brand.\n\n00:17:21:\n\n The K J.\n\n00:17:22:\n\n Miller brand productivity in Tech has stronger brand recognition than K.\n\n00:17:27:\n\n J.\n\n00:17:27:\n\n Miller does honestly, So I don't know why.\n\n00:17:30:\n\n I just don't just own it, but I don't know.\n\n00:17:33:\n\n I kind of like having my name on something, you know, it's kind of nice, but the one of the things that pit the business handles is doing transcriptions Right now.\n\n00:17:51:\n\n I'm working on, um, sealing the deal on a pretty good size project that will have me working or doing a lot of transcriptions in the near future, which is actually why I started working on this as much as I did.\n\n00:18:08:\n\n That project also led me to adding support for transcribing video two transcript her before it was just I worked with your audio.\n\n00:18:22:\n\n I give you a transcript and we call it a deal.\n\n00:18:25:\n\n Now it is.\n\n00:18:28:\n\n Hey, we support sub rib, which is SRT, which is kind of like the subtitles that have been that you see on, like, DVDs and like, YouTube and all that stuff.\n\n00:18:38:\n\n So now transcript or supports that.\n\n00:18:42:\n\n But in working on that, the problem that I always run into is there always seems to be a hiccup when you start talking about developer focused praises as a python developer, you know, we talk about like, Jenga.\n\n00:19:04:\n\n We talk about, um, trying to think of some other Gunn's sequel.\n\n00:19:08:\n\n Alchemy is a good one.\n\n00:19:11:\n\n Ah, post grass is another good one.\n\n00:19:18:\n\n So, and working on that, I generate the transcription first using a machine transcription.\n\n00:19:29:\n\n So like Amazon transcribe is what I use currently I may switch over to azure speech to text because it looks like it's like it's just better.\n\n00:19:40:\n\n I think it's cheaper to, so that's kind of nice We'll have to see.\n\n00:19:47:\n\n But the thing that makes transcription slow is after you get those machine generated transcriptions.\n\n00:20:04:\n\n You didn't have to go through them again by hand and make any corrections, adjust lines.\n\n00:20:11:\n\n All those things that make doing transcriptions more complicated.\n\n00:20:22:\n\n Then one would think.\n\n00:20:25:\n\n In fact, that's why transcriptions are relatively expensive, mine included.\n\n00:20:37:\n\n That's also why a lot of folks don't want to transcribe their content.\n\n00:20:47:\n\n Which brings me to a couple of things.\n\n00:20:51:\n\n One.\n\n00:20:52:\n\n The Future of Transcript Transcript er is first and foremost a wrapper around all of these transcription tools.\n\n00:21:01:\n\n It's designed so that you basically give it whatever service you want.\n\n00:21:06:\n\n You tell to run.\n\n00:21:08:\n\n It runs easy day.\n\n00:21:11:\n\n You don't have to think about which service you want to use, which one's better or whatever, and maybe you do when I think about that.\n\n00:21:19:\n\n But you can kind of switch off using the same methods and names and systems and just go for it.\n\n00:21:31:\n\n But I want to follow up on that with knowledge that will allow me to analyze the work that's being done and come up with rational solutions for common errors in the system and before you message me.\n\n00:22:05:\n\n Yes, I know most of these systems have dictionaries that you can input and load and all these things.\n\n00:22:15:\n\n And maybe in a perfect world, we would build those dictionaries and add them to each one and solve all the problems of the world.\n\n00:22:24:\n\n But here is the problem.\n\n00:22:28:\n\n If I need to load Django phrases if I need to load dot net phrases dotnet terminology into my system, I have the one create that that vocabulary for each of the systems that I'm using.\n\n00:22:51:\n\n Then I have toe upload those vocabularies, and every system is different.\n\n00:22:58:\n\n Some of them have restrictions.\n\n00:22:59:\n\n Some of them don't.\n\n00:23:04:\n\n Then any time it changes.\n\n00:23:07:\n\n Like those vocabulary phrases didn't have to be pulled down, updated, re uploaded, all that good stuff.\n\n00:23:14:\n\n Wouldn't it be easier if I just went with what I got and use the power of quote unquote machine learning to make those changes after the fact?\n\n00:23:28:\n\n And that's what I'm thinking of doing now, and that's a huge project that I would love your support on that Project one.\n\n00:23:36:\n\n It's gonna be open source.\n\n00:23:37:\n\n If you want to contribute code to it, that's great, too.\n\n00:23:40:\n\n I'm gonna need a large data sets reaching out to conference organizers and transcribers once I have this system more robust.\n\n00:23:52:\n\n My goal is to reach out to content creators who are building these transcription libraries, whether it's developer podcasters, whether it's YouTubers, whether it's course creators, whether it's, um, Conference organizer's, there will be a lot of information joining the Web.\n\n00:24:27:\n\n And the gate keepers of the video industry do not seem to want to put forward tools that will help share the load of work that needs to be done.\n\n00:24:51:\n\n YouTube just announced that community contributions will no longer be added to the system.\n\n00:24:58:\n\n I think it's like at the end of the month I think this is a terrible decision, mostly in that many content creators do not have the knowledge to open source their transcriptions in a way that many people can make updates and access them.\n\n00:25:24:\n\n But also many people don't focus on the accessibility impacts of transcriptions, and it will take someone else in the community to help with that that charge so by YouTube saying, we're not gonna let the community contribute to transcriptions or close captions.\n\n00:25:59:\n\n And I know the argument is that not enough people are using the tool.\n\n00:26:04:\n\n I doubted something that you would say is too expensive because you're still gonna offer the exact same.\n\n00:26:11:\n\n The resource is for the content Creator.\n\n00:26:18:\n\n You're not getting rid of transcriptions completely.\n\n00:26:22:\n\n I don't understand why you get rid of this service.\n\n00:26:25:\n\n Maybe you do.\n\n00:26:26:\n\n You don't make it visible on like the front screen.\n\n00:26:29:\n\n Maybe they have to go and like, go to like the more options and, you know, click it in there or something.\n\n00:26:36:\n\n But I don't think it was something that needed to disappear, unless Google is like doing what they usually do, which is constantly shifting the focus of people from one area to another.\n\n00:26:51:\n\n And the easiest way to do that is to remove the area of focus for them.\n\n00:26:55:\n\n Currently, which leads me to my last point.\n\n00:27:08:\n\n Earlier this month, there was these congressional hearings with four of the major companies in the tech space apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.\n\n00:27:26:\n\n While the conversation of antitrust in some of these conversations I thought were a pervy in Some weren't to me.\n\n00:27:37:\n\n What I and more afraid of now, could be best summed up in a wonderful thought that I saw on Twitter today.\n\n00:27:58:\n\n This came from Chris Hold graph on Twitter.\n\n00:28:02:\n\n You should give him a follows C Hold a graph of the link in the show notes that says, Do you folks think that we're about to enter a new era of centralisation and open source?\n\n00:28:14:\n\n It feels like more more tool chains, framework services and etcetera are controlled by fewer organizations.\n\n00:28:24:\n\n Here's of what scares me.\n\n00:28:28:\n\n Currently, I'm not trying to compete with the biggest names in transcriptions.\n\n00:28:36:\n\n In fact, I'm using their open source tools and requiring that people that use transcript er provide their own credentials for them.\n\n00:28:51:\n\n So if you want to use Transcript er, you have tohave.\n\n00:28:54:\n\n Currently, you have to have an AWS account.\n\n00:28:59:\n\n I'm All I'm doing is making making it easier to use their service.\n\n00:29:05:\n\n But I already see a problem when, in terms of conferences, there are very few choices that people can go with that air affordable and know the lingo of the developer.\n\n00:29:30:\n\n They're very few stenographers that could do real time, close captioning guage.\n\n00:29:34:\n\n It's still amazing to me.\n\n00:29:36:\n\n I wish I wish I knew how to do, um, the Stiner type like stuff that blows my mind.\n\n00:29:45:\n\n I love those conversations with folks, but at the end of the day, we need more companies.\n\n00:30:00:\n\n Right now, there is a huge amount of wealth in Silicon Valley that resides in the hands of less than 100 people.\n\n00:30:20:\n\n That's not to say that there aren't other people out there that are really doing it.\n\n00:30:24:\n\n I saw there was a wonderful block posts about Tailwind, like growing to be like a multi $1,000,000 business and stuff like that, which I think is amazing.\n\n00:30:33:\n\n Um, I have my questions about why it, Selwyn, because I'm just not a fan of the u I.\n\n00:30:39:\n\n But that's me that doesn't take away from the stuff that they're doing.\n\n00:30:47:\n\n There have been so many conversations on this podcast on other shows about the idea of fixing the the wealth disparity in America, and I think a big part of that is reducing the amount of oneness in American technology.\n\n00:31:18:\n\n Every company that is doing something great is one acquisition away from it being a feature, a feature that could be removed.\n\n00:31:32:\n\n It will a feature that can be regulated and locked down and a feature that can be monetized to the extreme.\n\n00:31:41:\n\n And I'm not saying that this happens with every single feature, But we've seen it time and time again, where a great idea gets swallowed by a larger company for the patents, for the licensing and for the economy.\n\n00:32:00:\n\n And in doing that, we're now stifling the ability to distribute wealth amongst the many and instead that wealth remains in the hands of the few.\n\n00:32:21:\n\n Now I'm not here to solve the economy problems, but what I can do is follow the mission statement That is, productivity in tech.\n\n00:32:37:\n\n And that is we are a company that helps people in tech create content for people in tech and anything that would cause us to skill.\n\n00:32:55:\n\n Beyond that focus is something that I'm not quite interested in, and it's something that I would question if there others out there that want to help achieve that goal.\n\n00:33:17:\n\n I don't believe that it has to be everybody's mission.\n\n00:33:20:\n\n I think that there's a good a good opportunity for people to help people that aren't in the tech space there some wonderful knishes that can be helped.\n\n00:33:30:\n\n In fact, many of the tools that I make could be used outside of the tech space.\n\n00:33:35:\n\n It just so happens that I build them with the developer first.\n\n00:33:40:\n\n So a lot of the decisions that I'm making are based on that.\n\n00:33:49:\n\n So I'm gonna wrap it up there with this episode.\n\n00:33:55:\n\n If you want to connect with me, you can do so.\n\n00:33:57:\n\n Cagey miller dot com Of course, you can follow the podcast podcast.\n\n00:34:00:\n\n Stop productivity in tech dot com.\n\n00:34:03:\n\n Productivity intact is all one word.\n\n00:34:06:\n\n And of course, if you like render engine transcript or any of the developer works that I'm doing, you can support my work on Get Hub using to get have sponsors link in the show notes.\n\n00:34:20:\n\n Now, Thank you so much for listening.\n\n00:34:24:\n\n I hope that we've been productive.\n\n00:34:26:\n\n I hope that we've inspired you to think a little bit about what you're doing currently, and I hope that you will challenge the thoughts of the majority of the power being in the hands of the few when it comes to the economy.\n\n00:34:48:\n\n When it comes to ownership of Open source.\n\n00:34:52:\n\n And ultimately, when it comes to your productivity, I would challenge you to do something that's just for you.\n\n00:35:06:\n\n Do something that's gonna, I hope, solve your goal.\n\n00:35:11:\n\n Don't do it for the money.\n\n00:35:14:\n\n Don't do it for the accolades.\n\n00:35:16:\n\n Do it because you want to learn.\n\n00:35:19:\n\n Do it publicly.\n\n00:35:21:\n\n Make mistakes is miss.\n\n00:35:23:\n\n Result would say, Take chances, get messy.\n\n00:35:28:\n\n But ultimately, that's the ticket to being more productive.\n\n00:35:32:\n\n I'm Jay Millar.\n\n00:35:33:\n\n This spin productivity in tech

J. Miller here back with another productivity in tech podcast. I hope you're having a fantastic week and mine just got a little bit better because I have the wonder and privilege to talk to someone that I have known for\n\nJay 00:00:36:\n\nGod like six years now And one of the first people I met when I became a programmer Ah always brings a smile to my face to see them Talks are absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And also just a generally overall just glowing person. Not because the radioactive, but because they just know how to brighten up a room. I am talking with the one the only Melanie crutch build. Melanie is so good to see you.\n\nMelanie 00:01:09:\n\nWow, I The glowing, I think is like I think this is just fire of, like, embarrassment on my face now because you know\n\nJay 00:01:19:\n\nthe first of a nice say, like San Diego wildfires like G, it's like, well, not really\n\nMelanie 00:01:24:\n\nknow Now I think it\n\nJay 00:01:26:\n\nstarted. I guess so,\n\nMelanie 00:01:29:\n\nYeah, we're we're hanging in there so far like\n\nMelanie 00:01:33:\n\nit's funny. It didn't quite into my consciousness that we have like yet another plague that we could layer onto 2020 like he's, you know, like of the seven layer salad of For that, 2020 is becoming like fires. I almost forgot, J thank you.\n\nJay 00:01:54:\n\nUnder, I\n\nMelanie 00:01:55:\n\nguess.\n\nMelanie 00:01:57:\n\nAh,\n\nMelanie 00:01:58:\n\n2020. Bless it.\n\nJay 00:02:00:\n\nYes. So other than the obvious, um, perils that air plaguing America right now. How have you been? Generally?\n\nMelanie 00:02:12:\n\nUh,\n\nMelanie 00:02:13:\n\nyeah. Well,\n\nMelanie 00:02:16:\n\num\n\nMelanie 00:02:18:\n\nokay, so my my measurements of how I'm doing might be slightly different than the average person. Like if I\n\nMelanie 00:02:30:\n\nand awake\n\nMelanie 00:02:32:\n\nand I have clothes on my body Bonus bonus. Both of those air working today, I have fed my cells.\n\nMelanie 00:02:41:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:02:44:\n\nyeah, and I got a couple of things done today. I mean, that's like, I'm like, living my best life\n\nMelanie 00:02:50:\n\nat that point.\n\nMelanie 00:02:52:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:02:54:\n\nbecause, like,\n\nMelanie 00:02:56:\n\nit is, uh, often that those are not my days. You know, um, that they don't quite look like that because of, um because I have major depressive disorder. Um, I also have, like a really fun and exciting relationship with migraines, So there's that I have the anxiety. I have epilepsy, which is is fun,\n\nMelanie 00:03:23:\n\nthat it's well controlled, so it's not as it's not as interesting or imitating as it might be. otherwise so, um,\n\nMelanie 00:03:31:\n\nbut the, you know, the depression really gives you a completely different, um, scale of success,\n\nMelanie 00:03:38:\n\nI guess. Is what what I might call it. So\n\nJay 00:03:43:\n\nas someone who often has to tell people in social environments of like, hey, if I start laughing really hard, can you just make sure I don't collapse? Um, I can relate. Um, that has the last few years ever since, you know, cardiac episode after cardiac episode,\n\nJay 00:04:02:\n\nyou do start to take a lot of things that other people I guess we take for granted. You, like, treat them as this has been a good day. I haven't blacked out in five days like OK, that is that is like an awesome feeling. All\n\nMelanie 00:04:17:\n\nright.\n\nJay 00:04:17:\n\nSo I can I can totally relate\n\nJay 00:04:21:\n\nto where you're coming from their Well,\n\nJay 00:04:24:\n\ndo me a favor, because I know you well, but the people listening to the show probably don't know you as well as ideo. So kind of Introduce yourself. Let people know who you are, what you do and, uh, ultimately like, what brings you joy in the tech space?\n\nMelanie 00:04:42:\n\nOh, good gracious. OK,\n\nJay 00:04:43:\n\njust some smiles, you know?\n\nMelanie 00:04:45:\n\nYeah, Just anybody stuff? Um, let's see. I am a python and jingle developer.\n\nMelanie 00:04:53:\n\nUm, I am self taught. I went to two years of college and then\n\nMelanie 00:05:01:\n\ndidn't go to college after that. Which they still turned you for. Interestingly love? Um, yeah. Uh, wow. Yeah. And spread this whole different thing. But private school is a racket. I don't know why you do that. Um, yes. So I did that I\n\nMelanie 00:05:20:\n\nand then much later in life, I got into development because it is fun.\n\nMelanie 00:05:26:\n\nUm, I started out like my professional life was in fine art photographic printing. So I had about a decade of, ah, life in the art world there, which makes it sound much sexier than it was. Um, although it was fun and good, like, that was a good time. And then\n\nMelanie 00:05:46:\n\nI had my first daughter and kind of rejected out of the job, seen for a while. And when I came back,\n\nMelanie 00:05:54:\n\nI wanted to do something that, like,\n\nMelanie 00:05:57:\n\ncompensated for my time in a in a decent way, you know, especially living in San Diego. Um, and\n\nMelanie 00:06:07:\n\nI just thought, you know, I had done I have done some little like apple script scripts. Do you know what this thing is? What? Apples with this? Yeah,\n\nMelanie 00:06:17:\n\nyou\n\nJay 00:06:17:\n\nget a few of them. Ah,\n\nJay 00:06:20:\n\nusually ones that turn my mic off because I am notorious for, like, ending a conversation being done and then later on, just being like, Oh, the recording still going And then like having three hours of just dead audio toe toe work on?\n\nMelanie 00:06:36:\n\nYeah, yeah, it's just a little fiddly stuff like that. And so I am. I made some scripts, like, way back\n\nMelanie 00:06:45:\n\nmany, many years ago. I don't know, 15 years ago or something, And, uh\n\nMelanie 00:06:50:\n\nso when I was trying to figure out where am I gonna go now with my career and loves, like, you know, I had fun with that. I'm one,\n\nMelanie 00:06:59:\n\nyou know, making computers do stuff. Like maybe I could do some of that same born, um, and then came, you know, in my learning process came across the python community in San Diego and like\n\nMelanie 00:07:11:\n\nthat was it. That's how I am. Kind of got my heat settled.\n\nMelanie 00:07:17:\n\nSo, um, I work in a rightly or really not the car shop, as we were discussing earlier. Um, although I have repaired my car in a variety of ways on my own.\n\nMelanie 00:07:29:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:07:31:\n\nit still works. It still runs Most of the things we're still on there. It does have a weird rattle. Um, anyway, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:07:39:\n\nand my little side projects five up is still\n\nMelanie 00:07:44:\n\nup and running.\n\nMelanie 00:07:46:\n\nSo\n\nMelanie 00:07:48:\n\nthat's me. I have two kids. I'm cat\n\nMelanie 00:07:51:\n\nE, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:07:53:\n\nBut I think that's it. The end. Is there more? What else should I say?\n\nJay 00:07:58:\n\nNo, that's it. That's good podcast. No, no, we're gonna look, look, goingto a lot of more detail than that, but but yeah, let's let's start with you know, one of the things that you just brought up was\n\nJay 00:08:11:\n\nyou wanted to do a job that you felt you were being compensated for. I guess I would say as fairly as\n\nJay 00:08:22:\n\nweird systems that can\n\nJay 00:08:25:\n\nYeah, we're not gonna go into that conversation. That's another podcast. But, ah, the big thing was, it wasn't, You know, development wasn't something that you were like.\n\nJay 00:08:36:\n\nHey, I'm, like, 14 and hacking in tow. You know, the U S treasury and I've always been a programmer, and like, it wasn't like this whole crazy lifestyle thing for Yeah, I was like,\n\nJay 00:08:50:\n\nHere's a small piece of my life that I do that\n\nJay 00:08:54:\n\nI mean, it be cool if I got paid to do this. I mean, like that. That's a really\n\nJay 00:08:59:\n\ninteresting approach, because it kind of goes against what everybody is taught. You know, when you go to high school, you have to do like, Oh, yeah, you know, you need to go to the best school toe, get into engineering or get into our did to get into all these things. And it's like\n\nJay 00:09:16:\n\nor you could just live your life, do the things that you enjoy doing and then find something in that realm that actually gives you a paycheck and then do that and then in your free time, make really cool stuff like five up, which we're gonna talk about later. Um, so So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool. Did you find a challenge? Ah, like, did you find it challenging to get into the tech space, Not having the I went toe Caltech or m I t. And you know up. You know, I was born with a keyboard in my hand, like that whole mindset.\n\nMelanie 00:09:52:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:09:55:\n\nit's tricky because I feel like not having those types of credentials.\n\nMelanie 00:10:06:\n\nI still like it.\n\nMelanie 00:10:08:\n\nIt affects me like it means more to me than it does to other people. You know, I'm\n\nMelanie 00:10:16:\n\nI'm grateful. I mean, that's from my experience. Like, I'm grateful that I hade, um, the experience of applying to Riley in working through that process and not\n\nMelanie 00:10:31:\n\nnot having the pressure to have some sort of pedigree\n\nMelanie 00:10:36:\n\nin intact.\n\nMelanie 00:10:39:\n\nSo I didn't experience that, But it is always really interesting to talk, Teoh. Other folks that do you have an experience? I was talking to someone the other day who was mentioning that, um, it just so happened that in there, like a p\n\nMelanie 00:10:59:\n\ncomputer science class that they had,\n\nMelanie 00:11:03:\n\nthey're like senior year in high school, which, first of all, ending a farming town.\n\nMelanie 00:11:09:\n\nWe had f A like\n\nMelanie 00:11:12:\n\nalso way.\n\nMelanie 00:11:14:\n\nThe way that my life shook out. I only I graduated early, surly had, like, one semester of my senior year. And then I went and, like, works in a coffee shop after that, you know, like\n\nMelanie 00:11:25:\n\nour situations were like small time, different So but he,\n\nMelanie 00:11:30:\n\nyou know, was saying\n\nMelanie 00:11:33:\n\nin my\n\nMelanie 00:11:34:\n\nin my a p\n\nMelanie 00:11:36:\n\nCS class.\n\nMelanie 00:11:39:\n\nThe teacher happens to know, like the super good friends that someone high up in, you know, X y z tech, like in a huge tech company. And so this BP or whatever from this big tech company comes in and does like, practice interviews with every limits in the class. They're seniors, the high school, they're like 17. You know what I'm saying? Like were 18 or however old they are. They're teenagers, though, for sure. So there's these\n\nMelanie 00:12:07:\n\nteenagers. Some of them then got jobs like straight out of high school.\n\nMelanie 00:12:13:\n\nIt's like I was just kind of like,\n\nMelanie 00:12:17:\n\nwhoa,\n\nMelanie 00:12:19:\n\nyou know, like\n\nMelanie 00:12:20:\n\nand I know that, um,\n\nMelanie 00:12:24:\n\nyou know, you were saying\n\nMelanie 00:12:26:\n\na second ago like we don't want to get into the whole, like, inequality and what's like, you know, fair compensation and stuff.\n\nMelanie 00:12:33:\n\nUm, but it is just kind of\n\nMelanie 00:12:36:\n\nit is kind of mind blowing, right that some people do walk into the tech space saying, you know, I have\n\nMelanie 00:12:44:\n\nI have all these credentials. I have all these this experiments, you know, and I'm like one of the computer stuff, but which I did.\n\nMelanie 00:12:55:\n\nI did have a continuing everyone Yeah, yeah,\n\nMelanie 00:13:01:\n\nI've played Tetris super good at it\n\nJay 00:13:05:\n\nfor me. I always hesitate, you know, toe to talk about kind of the entrance into the tech space, Um, from any level of knowledge, because I technically haven't entered the development space working on it trying really am. But, you know, it is interesting to hear, you know,\n\nJay 00:13:27:\n\nthe conversation of\n\nJay 00:13:30:\n\nyou have a perfect example\n\nJay 00:13:33:\n\ngiving a resume to someone or like this, presenting a resume to a company and, like having two people\n\nJay 00:13:40:\n\nlook at your resume and tell you to conflicting things like one is like, Oh, you need to focus on your projects more because you don't have the job experience and one says, Oh, but your other job experience is super relatable for a higher management position, so you should focus on that more, and it's like, Okay, I have one person telling me to put my job experience at the front. The other one told me to put my projects at the front. I can't put them both there like I need writing something. So it it's always interesting to hear the idea of like\n\nJay 00:14:11:\n\nit can't be this hard\n\nJay 00:14:13:\n\nfor everybody, and it's not necessarily.\n\nJay 00:14:18:\n\nYou know, I don't have a solution for that, but I would just I love hearing people address that, like OK, yeah.\n\nJay 00:14:26:\n\nFor some people, it was extremely easy for others. It was a little bit harder. And then for some, they're still trying to get their foot in the door. Um,\n\nJay 00:14:36:\n\nbut at the end of the day, I'm glad for some of the people who have\n\nJay 00:14:41:\n\ngone through whatever they did,\n\nJay 00:14:44:\n\nbecause now they know what it took, which means they're willing to help other people not have to go through that same thing.\n\nMelanie 00:14:52:\n\nYeah,\n\nMelanie 00:14:53:\n\nAnd I have to say, like, you know, I worked hard. I tried to learn, I went to conferences and, you know, I built my thing, and I did\n\nMelanie 00:15:04:\n\nThose couple of talks like, I put time and energy into it,\n\nMelanie 00:15:11:\n\nbut I knew someone. I honestly think that networking is huge,\n\nMelanie 00:15:19:\n\nwhich is also\n\nMelanie 00:15:23:\n\njust a huge, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:15:27:\n\nplayground for injustice\n\nMelanie 00:15:30:\n\nright\n\nJay 00:15:30:\n\nnow\n\nJay 00:15:32:\n\nbecause not everybody knows. Well, it I guess the hard part is, is like, if you know someone, you could get a foot in the door. But like\n\nJay 00:15:41:\n\nthe people that don't know anyone have a problem And then there's also like\n\nJay 00:15:46:\n\nthe We don't want to punish you for bringing in the wrong people kind of feeling that they come that comes with it. Like I I see so many people of color that air in\n\nJay 00:15:58:\n\nmanagement levels that work with no other people of color. And it's just like,\n\nJay 00:16:05:\n\nI mean, I'm glad you're not like using it as a way to, like, bring just anybody in. But at the same time, it seems really weird that, like there's not one and it and it's because of that. It's like, Well, if I\n\nJay 00:16:20:\n\nWhat if I make a mistake? What if I I have a bad higher and they happen to be a person of color? And then now you're making the problem even worse and even harder for other people in it. It's like again,\n\nJay 00:16:33:\n\nI just wish that it wasn't this hard for everyone and that they didn't have to go to sleep, you know, worrying about their job because they hired someone that they know is capable of doing the work. But because of how they look, you know, it could be a problem. But\n\nJay 00:16:46:\n\nultimately, I don't think that the conversation we're gonna have here is probably gonna solve that problem. But I do hope that someone listening, uh, maybe you can, you know, solve a smaller problem like that and you know your own little world.\n\nJay 00:17:02:\n\nBut you talked about\n\nJay 00:17:05:\n\nyou know, you\n\nJay 00:17:06:\n\nall the things that you did Do you know, aside from knowing someone like you gave the talks, you built the thing. Like when I first met you,\n\nJay 00:17:17:\n\nI was trying to build a thing\n\nJay 00:17:19:\n\nand, like, I had no clue what I was doing. And I think, um, a good like, a couple of mutual friends of ours were just like\n\nJay 00:17:27:\n\nI mean, this is a cool idea. What are you doing\n\nMelanie 00:17:31:\n\non? I mean,\n\nJay 00:17:33:\n\nI I had probably I'd probably been using Python for maybe, like, a week and 1/2. So it was like, I have an exact problem. I've solved it in kind of this really ugly way. Now I want to take it to the next step and solve it in a slightly less ugly way. And in doing that, I just kind of screwed it up. But I'm going to talk about your\n\nJay 00:17:56:\n\nDjango app that just brings joy into the world and phones of people. So I'm just gonna I'm going to just sit back and let you just talk about about the app. Talk about the idea for it. Talk about you know what it's been like running it for as long as you've been running. I can't I can't imagine. Like,\n\nJay 00:18:16:\n\nI don't think I have anything that's been in the wild for, like, more than a year.\n\nMelanie 00:18:22:\n\nYeah. Um, so\n\nMelanie 00:18:25:\n\nfive opap dot com\n\nMelanie 00:18:27:\n\nIt's a Django out.\n\nMelanie 00:18:29:\n\nUm, it is not a phone app. I have to say the whole I was just thinking about this today. I think five up dot com was taken. And so I think that's where I went with five. Look after Tom. But to non tech people, like they're like, what's the thing that I download in the night? Just have to say, I'm sorry I made a thing that's confusing. Just\n\nMelanie 00:18:51:\n\njust ignore that for a second and felt the form and give me all of your personal contact information.\n\nMelanie 00:18:57:\n\nAnd then something good is gonna happen. Trust possibly did. Yeah. I mean, I'm a random person on the Internet. Why not? You know. So, um, yes. So what it does is it sends happy texts every day. That's its only function. That's all it does. I got the idea. It's build it because I actually, um the first, like\n\nMelanie 00:19:23:\n\nclass that I took on python was through Udacity. And they have this bit in there Where you, um you had to make a little bit of a project using Tulio.\n\nMelanie 00:19:39:\n\nUm and so I had done, like, I had kind of come up with this idea of, like, isn't that when that be nice to just get happened? Texts\n\nMelanie 00:19:48:\n\nAnd part of the idea between our for sending five texts, which is what it was initially that you could only get five, and that was it. Like you're gonna have a quantity of five. Happy.\n\nMelanie 00:20:01:\n\nWe're guard lis of what you like. That's what you're getting. Um, but the idea is there's some research that, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:20:11:\n\nmaybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Whatever. Um, but this concept that need 3 to 5 positive things to outweigh each negatives thing that happens to you. So the idea is like, I'm kind of betting on a negative thing, but you every day. But I mean, if you end up with a surplus of happy. It's fine. It's time\n\nMelanie 00:20:36:\n\nnot to be upset about it. So eventually I changed it so that you can choose\n\nMelanie 00:20:42:\n\n1234 or five per day\n\nMelanie 00:20:46:\n\nbecause people were like, it's too happy\n\nMelanie 00:20:48:\n\nsaying they were actually just like is like a really, really happy person around you and your like, you're just annoying. Now. I'm sorry. Like I love the people are friendly and something is working well for you, but if you could do it away from me, that would be wonderful. So, um, video just a little bit of happened. Just one.\n\nMelanie 00:21:07:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:21:08:\n\nyeah, and\n\nMelanie 00:21:11:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:21:12:\n\nSo I came to the Python meet up with this, you know, kind of baby idea, this python script, Um, and then someone was like, oh, built the Django\n\nMelanie 00:21:22:\n\nand I was like, all right, you know, like,\n\nMelanie 00:21:26:\n\nand then it was just like months of being like I don't know what I'm doing at all and just going home and, like, suffering through, you know, trying to go through this development process and figure it was going on like\n\nMelanie 00:21:43:\n\nI didn't know it at the time, and I do now. It's kind of both comforting and in infuriating that like hours, hours, and hours, days, weeks of developers time are spent over, like a semi colon in the wrong place. You know, like just a single character, you know, or just this, these the tiniest thing. So, you know, I went two months of that and then eventually got it somewhat working. It was very buggy at first. Um, it is still kind of bugging. Actually Had someone report above a couple weeks ago, and I I almost have it. Thanks, but, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:22:27:\n\nyou know, life, but whatever.\n\nJay 00:22:30:\n\nWe need bugs in life, I guess.\n\nMelanie 00:22:33:\n\nYeah. I mean...No.\n\nMelanie 00:22:36:\n\nno, I got in your gardens\n\nMelanie 00:22:40:\n\nright there. Get in the garden. I always try to do that. Things I have young kids, you know where you're like. Let me spine\n\nMelanie 00:22:46:\n\nfinds him to be grateful for about that, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:22:51:\n\nbugs\n\nMelanie 00:22:52:\n\nreminds us that we're fallible or something. I\n\nJay 00:22:57:\n\nOh, that's that's too funny, though. And I love that, like, again. A lot of the story that came from from this was\n\nJay 00:23:08:\n\na level of like, I understand that that life sucks at times.\n\nJay 00:23:13:\n\nSo\n\nJay 00:23:15:\n\nat best I'm I'm leveling the playing field or I guess it. At worst, I'm leveling the playing field That best I'm giving you, like\n\nJay 00:23:24:\n\nextra happy. Which to me, that is That is like\n\nJay 00:23:30:\n\na lot of people know, like my favorite\n\nJay 00:23:33:\n\npersonality in the entire world is the late, great Bob Ross, and it was just like nobody on the planet should ever be. This happy like the guy, like adopt squirrels. It's,\n\nJay 00:23:48:\n\nI think, of the some of the greatest people that have ever lived. Like Nikola Tesla apparently married a pigeon like there's just a level of coziness that just comes with being\n\nJay 00:24:01:\n\nan amazing person. And I think that if you could be crazily like happy and just want other people to be justice crazily happy as you like that is the best possible outcome because the\n\nJay 00:24:18:\n\nthe worst\n\nMelanie 00:24:18:\n\nside of that is\n\nJay 00:24:19:\n\nlike serial killer. So it's like extremely happy sociopath. Serial killer. Where on the spectrum are you and right? So I love that one that you're using your coding skills for good and not sociopathic serial killer. He stuff,\n\nJay 00:24:35:\n\nYeah, but also that\n\nJay 00:24:39:\n\nyou pushed through because it was just suggested to you. Um, I am like the exact opposite of that someone tells me to build a jangle after like that. I don't want to build a jingle app. I want to build a flask app. I want a village static site generator like I want to do everything but the thing that everyone is telling me to do because they're telling me to do it this way. And I need to know why I shouldn't do it that 8000 other ways.\n\nJay 00:25:03:\n\nBut\n\nJay 00:25:05:\n\non top of that, you were actually willing to\n\nJay 00:25:09:\n\nshare that experience with the community and not just the app itself. But I've I've had the privilege of listening to what I would consider the greatest python conference talk ever. Um, which is like, so you want to build a jingle app? It's like\n\nJay 00:25:25:\n\nyou. You bring your personality into\n\nJay 00:25:30:\n\nall the things that you do like. I'm on the 50 website and it's like how it works. Sometimes life has sad things. We have happy messages,\n\nJay 00:25:38:\n\nthen\n\nMelanie 00:25:38:\n\nyou're not\n\nJay 00:25:39:\n\nso sad anymore. And it's just like\n\nJay 00:25:42:\n\nit doesn't have this weird like s CEO, like marketing spend using 15 different buzzwords for social ranking and like all of this other stuff that people try to do to game the system. It's like\n\nJay 00:25:57:\n\nit is\n\nJay 00:25:58:\n\ntruly a Melanie Appetite, Melanie website and time. I would be afraid to look at the code because I'm sure the comments would just have me laughing. It's like, This is stupid. I'm not gonna dio because that's what my code looks like. It's like, I hate that I have to\n\nMelanie 00:26:15:\n\ndo this\n\nJay 00:26:16:\n\nBut apparently Python hates me. So\n\nMelanie 00:26:20:\n\nusually those air like\n\nMelanie 00:26:22:\n\nI bet my get history\n\nMelanie 00:26:24:\n\nmy get history is where I hide my secret feelings for sure. Like less often. Yeah, exactly less often in the code itself, I think.\n\nMelanie 00:26:35:\n\nBut Gathers I think there's some some fun. Makes sense Is that there Are you looking girl, your eyes\n\nJay 00:26:45:\n\nlooking for a good one? Execute some lint ing c L. I love it. It's just like,\n\nMelanie 00:26:50:\n\nOh, see, that's recent. Yeah, that's me. Just do you want stuff cleaning up?\n\nJay 00:26:56:\n\nYeah, I mean, that's I probably should do deleted, weird static directory. Stuff like this\n\nMelanie 00:27:03:\n\nis I go. This is\n\nJay 00:27:04:\n\nthe stuff that I think developers need to see on a more regular basis because you get these weird posts or, like, how to write ineffective, get commit messages like I mean, yes, sure, I understand. If someone's reviewing your code, you want to make it as helpful when is clear and concise as possible, but at the same time being able to just get your frustration out a little bit and I get commit?\n\nJay 00:27:28:\n\nSure, do it. I think that's absolutely a wonderful way. Teoh, Uh, one not go insane, but to also again inject a little bit of yourself into your work. And, uh, I mean, you've always done that, But please tell everybody about some of the talks you've given about this about well, about the five up app. And also\n\nJay 00:27:53:\n\njust why just just why? Because the, um I can't even I can't even begin Teoh like breakdown like the talks themselves because they're so good.\n\nMelanie 00:28:07:\n\nAh, they really I mean, that's\n\nJay 00:28:09:\n\nthat's not me. Like, you know, trying to butter you up. I genuinely you made me try Django for the first time, literally.\n\nMelanie 00:28:16:\n\nYou're talking\n\nJay 00:28:17:\n\nlike OK, I will use Django, but only because Melanie said it's not as bad as it looks.\n\nMelanie 00:28:24:\n\nIt's not as bad as it looks. Um, yeah, So I\n\nMelanie 00:28:31:\n\nI think I only have the two talks that I ever\n\nMelanie 00:28:35:\n\nlike, actually gays. I gave them both multiple times, though, um, And then I did also do a, um,\n\nMelanie 00:28:44:\n\nlike an injured a python that life on a couple years in a row. Um, that waas, um,\n\nMelanie 00:28:51:\n\nin short, a python for human people with feelings.\n\nMelanie 00:28:55:\n\nUm, which was a lot of fun, I think. Like\n\nMelanie 00:29:00:\n\ngetting in and out on a 25 minute talk is way more manageable for me. Like I think that that's kind of my sweet spot. Three hours of like, having to make sense is pretty tricky.\n\nMelanie 00:29:13:\n\nJust like I'm so sorry. Everyone, you know,\n\nJay 00:29:16:\n\nthree hours long,\n\nMelanie 00:29:18:\n\nred, like in the end, you're just like, I don't know, let's talk about those bugs again or something. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:29:27:\n\nso, yeah, the first talk that I wrote waas about my experience writing five up and like\n\nMelanie 00:29:34:\n\nall of the things that I did long because some of them were kind of like\n\nMelanie 00:29:39:\n\na little bit tragic, you know, like I mean,\n\nMelanie 00:29:43:\n\nlike, recoverable, like I figured it out. But like,\n\nMelanie 00:29:46:\n\nyou know, my email and password were like, committed. And to get at some point\n\nMelanie 00:29:52:\n\nlike that, I agree\n\nMelanie 00:29:54:\n\nthat it's not the best.\n\nMelanie 00:29:56:\n\nUm And then just like accidentally destroying stuff, it's all these stuff. I mean, I don't know that everyone, like,\n\nMelanie 00:30:04:\n\nputs their email and password in their code. Like I feel like I kind of win on that one for, like, dumb stuff that you do on accident. Like I'm pretty\n\nJay 00:30:15:\n\nsure people have done Aziz Muchas They would admit they'd be like, No, I've never done that. I mean,\n\nJay 00:30:21:\n\nMiguel Road, like McGill did a talk about that. I think it pike on a couple of years ago. That's like you accidentally committed your password. Now what do you dio? And to me, that was great because it was saying like, OK,\n\nJay 00:30:35:\n\nprobably one of the most like prominent people to use the plastic framework is telling me that he has screwed up by putting, you know, some type of environment variable that shouldn't be in there or some type of password or some type of authentic r A p I key. That should not have been hard coded in there like he has done this. So when I mean after that talk, I was like, OK, I am team environment, variable for life like\n\nJay 00:31:02:\n\nthe first thing you see is like import os every time because I'm like I will not do that again. I've had that happen to me where someone's like,\n\nJay 00:31:11:\n\nYeah, heads up, You should Ah, like I submitted a PR that removed your password for you and I'm like, Oh, thank you for that.\n\nMelanie 00:31:19:\n\nCool, Great. That's hopeful.\n\nMelanie 00:31:23:\n\nYeah, exactly. So And I think\n\nMelanie 00:31:28:\n\nI don't know. I think it's important for people to know like\n\nMelanie 00:31:32:\n\nthere's there's no magic going on here. I mean, people do harder stuff than what Ideo like. I understand that, um, and that people are hearing like super fans and stuff. Andi. But\n\nMelanie 00:31:47:\n\nlike I'm fancy enough to be employed. So that's something you know and like\n\nMelanie 00:31:53:\n\nand it's not amazing it I mean, like, it's not. It's not so magical and difficult that you can't do it. You know that you can't like you can become a developer and also be a little bit of a bumbling weirdo like these things can be for you. You could be that in one thing. So like, and I I I feel like our fear of\n\nMelanie 00:32:19:\n\nwow\n\nMelanie 00:32:20:\n\nmaking mistakes\n\nMelanie 00:32:22:\n\nand like\n\nMelanie 00:32:24:\n\nbeing stealing hard,\n\nMelanie 00:32:26:\n\nkeeps us out of spaces where we could really fries. You know, um, and I always imagine that there's someone in the room that is sitting there being like,\n\nMelanie 00:32:37:\n\nWell, I could never you know, because that's me, like, 48\n\nMelanie 00:32:43:\n\n100% of the time I was gonna go 48%. But that's a lie. And 4800. It's not really a value that makes any sense, since, though,\n\nMelanie 00:32:52:\n\nand I have a job, everybody\n\nJay 00:32:54:\n\nand and the thing with that, like\n\nJay 00:32:59:\n\nI I grew up around\n\nJay 00:33:01:\n\nlike the biggest nerd in the world like my grandfather wanted me to be into computers like he let me take apart his computer. He made me put it back together. Um, like I grew up playing with the max, which is probably why I don't use the Mac's in Al.\n\nJay 00:33:19:\n\nLike I thought one of the first computer games was Eclipse, which is ah, like a job I d\n\nMelanie 00:33:28:\n\non. He was\n\nJay 00:33:29:\n\njust like, yeah, I just draw stuff in the things and I was like, OK, cool. I'm gonna make a computer game and, like No, no, I didn't. But he knew that I wasn't going to, but he was like Yeah, sure. Try it anyway. And like, this\n\nMelanie 00:33:40:\n\nis the kind of\n\nJay 00:33:41:\n\nguy that he went to the university library to doubt, like rent out algebra books for fun. And I'm just like your old man. You're supposed to be, like, watching like, daytime news and sleeping on the couch or something. And I always thought that that's what it meant to be like in the tech space of lying. So you gotta get a like\n\nJay 00:34:06:\n\nif you haven't read every Manning book that's out there, you have it. If you don't have, like, the subscription toe like O'Reilly learning, then you're doing it wrong. You need toe. You need to, like,\n\nJay 00:34:17:\n\nhave submitted, like at least three talks toe every major conference using your language. You need to have been to every talk. Like I hear about all the people that love and fawn over WWDC, and they're like, Oh, it's like\n\nJay 00:34:33:\n\nthe mecca for IOS developers is like, Oh, it's like the mecca for conference viruses. So you probably shouldn't like\n\nJay 00:34:42:\n\nput that stigma on people. Not everyone wants to go to a conference. Everyone is can understand half of what you know,\n\nJay 00:34:52:\n\nsomeone who has a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering and has turned that into, like writing functional algorithms using Haskell like not everyone can do.\n\nMelanie 00:35:05:\n\nNot everyone can understand that. And if\n\nJay 00:35:07:\n\nyou don't, it's okay. Like\n\nMelanie 00:35:09:\n\nI think\n\nJay 00:35:10:\n\nPython, because it's readable, literally showed\n\nJay 00:35:13:\n\n100 lines of python code that I had written Teoh, a graphic designer, and they were like,\n\nJay 00:35:19:\n\nI think you miss. I think there's a space after this comma that's not supposed to be there. And I was like,\n\nMelanie 00:35:24:\n\nHow are you debugging my\n\nMelanie 00:35:29:\n\nlike that to\n\nJay 00:35:30:\n\nme is amazing that people can look at the code, read it and understand what's happening, and that it eliminates the stigma of like you have to have void and no parameters instead of code and and it immediately closes the door on people who are just like, Yeah, I just wanna send five happy tweets. You know, our five happy text to my phone like, Can I do that?\n\nMelanie 00:35:53:\n\nNo. One?\n\nMelanie 00:35:55:\n\nNo, I I love Python. For that reason, I do think like it's one of the more low entry languages out there.\n\nMelanie 00:36:05:\n\nI've been working with Java script a little bit in the last couple of weeks, and I want to love all languages equally.\n\nMelanie 00:36:19:\n\nI want that so bad.\n\nMelanie 00:36:21:\n\nAlso Pythons the best. I don't know. I don't. I'm sorry, everyone. I just\n\nMelanie 00:36:28:\n\nIt's just clean ends.\n\nMelanie 00:36:32:\n\nI don't know. It's it's low entry. I think, Um,\n\nMelanie 00:36:37:\n\nyeah, it's good stuff, but what you were saying, um,\n\nMelanie 00:36:42:\n\na second ago about\n\nMelanie 00:36:44:\n\nthis huge range of like one\n\nMelanie 00:36:48:\n\nyou know, one engineer has a PhD in is doing this grace and stuff, you know, down to like, here's me,\n\nMelanie 00:36:56:\n\nyou know, making my little Web app. That doesn't silly and nice thing.\n\nMelanie 00:37:01:\n\nUm, that\n\nMelanie 00:37:03:\n\nthat gap\n\nMelanie 00:37:06:\n\nwas really difficult and overwhelming to experience at my first pie con, Um, because it's, you know what, like 3500 people or something. And you do have these people that have their doctorates and, you know, like listening to some of the talks. I remember because I was, you know, obviously much newer to Python at the time. Um, but I remember just being like I'm not doing,\n\nMelanie 00:37:35:\n\nyou know, like we'd go into a room and there's like, Here's a 20 minute talk\n\nMelanie 00:37:40:\n\nand, like I know they said words and there were slides like there were visuals, so a lot of stuff happening there. And yet\n\nMelanie 00:37:48:\n\nI have no idea what just happened.\n\nMelanie 00:37:52:\n\nSo\n\nMelanie 00:37:54:\n\nno, you know, And then\n\nMelanie 00:37:57:\n\nthe,\n\nMelanie 00:37:58:\n\nyou know, kind of the little circles of people that\n\nMelanie 00:38:02:\n\nthen joined up in our like, you know, what do you dio And\n\nMelanie 00:38:06:\n\nyou know, like, I do fancy things, You know? I'm like\n\nMelanie 00:38:11:\n\nHyson tweets the tell you your sparkling mermaid, not tweets and text messages, You know, actual message by the way you mentioned earlier. Bob Ross. Do you know that? I quote Bob Breast in private.\n\nJay 00:38:24:\n\nI didn't. And now\n\nJay 00:38:27:\n\nI I don't get text messages. City\n\nJay 00:38:31:\n\nI mean,\n\nMelanie 00:38:31:\n\nI probably drug simple.\n\nJay 00:38:32:\n\nNo, it's not you. It's I go, Yeah, I did this thing where it was like, don't ever get a message or like, a phone call from anyone that's on your favorites. And ever since then, people like chaos and your message lychee After you did\n\nJay 00:38:49:\n\ne don't get half my messages anymore, which is great, cause I have plausible deniability. Anytime I don't want to do something like I didn't get the message. I'm sorry.\n\nMelanie 00:38:56:\n\nYeah, I think that's awesome.\n\nMelanie 00:38:59:\n\nI mean, you broke up with me, and I just found out\n\nMelanie 00:39:03:\n\nand we literally had a like It's not years me moments that happened\n\nMelanie 00:39:10:\n\nthat's gonna be on the Internet now is fine. Oh, man.\n\nMelanie 00:39:14:\n\nScience. My received text that I send myself. That's what I going to dio like self wish that I do. Now\n\nJay 00:39:23:\n\nI'm gonna do the horrible thing you should never do after a breakup. I'm just gonna keep going forward.\n\nJay 00:39:28:\n\nThank\n\nJay 00:39:32:\n\nyou. Talked about, like, just kind of the vast difference of conversations that air had it conferences.\n\nJay 00:39:42:\n\nI gave my first conference talk at North Bay Python last year and, uh,\n\nMelanie 00:39:50:\n\nI couldn't go. So a conference, it\n\nJay 00:39:53:\n\nreally isn't there not having won this year, which I mean,\n\nJay 00:39:57:\n\nAnd\n\nJay 00:39:58:\n\nthey announced it last year that they were having won. I felt like I felt like they\n\nMelanie 00:40:02:\n\nfeel like\n\nJay 00:40:02:\n\nJosh knew he was just like, something's gonna happen. He's like, we don't want to be a part of it. We're out this year will see on two years. But\n\nJay 00:40:12:\n\none of the talks, that was it was like the second I was the last talk in the first half. And then the next talk after me was Greedo. And he was talking about writing. He was\n\nMelanie 00:40:25:\n\ntalking about writing\n\nJay 00:40:25:\n\na peg par surfer python. And I'm just like\n\nMelanie 00:40:29:\n\nI don't know what\n\nJay 00:40:30:\n\nyou're talking about. I'm gonna look, and I'm just gonna be like, Okay, Yeah, sure, whatever. And then we all got dinner together and it was me,\n\nJay 00:40:41:\n\nyou know, And then, like a couple of other developers that are like python core maintainers and I'm just like\n\nJay 00:40:48:\n\nand luckily, my talk was mostly about podcasting, So I felt like I knew what I was talking about, but they were all like, Ah, yes. So I would really love to learn how like podcasting could be implemented, you know, in a larger\n\nJay 00:41:04:\n\naudience in the python community. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I would love to learn more about whatever it is you talked about earlier to Andi. That's like, That's the crazy feeling that when we create this facade that, like, you have to have a PhD, you have to be, you know,\n\nJay 00:41:23:\n\na huge brainiac to write code that matters. What you're doing is you're taking your skill set away from the people that could genuinely benefit from the things that you can bring to the table like has a podcaster I know way more than any human should about dealing with transcriptions with AWS and\n\nJay 00:41:47:\n\nhaving these talks with mentors where it's like,\n\nJay 00:41:51:\n\nHey, I built a framework that does like it creates a\n\nJay 00:41:55:\n\nstandard schema for transcription. So matter what Web service you're using, whatever developable law. And they're just like,\n\nJay 00:42:02:\n\nwhy? I was like because you told me I needed a project that would make me hire Well, that's why. And they're like But why that when I was like, Well, it's because it's a thing that I have to deal with on a regular basis. So and as we're breaking it down and like talking about it, they're just like,\n\nJay 00:42:18:\n\nWait,\n\nJay 00:42:20:\n\nwhat you built this I'm like, Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but like, you know, this is like, this is stuff that you would give, like a keynote talk on, like the whole process of building this stuff. And it's like I just had a problem that I need to solve. So I solved it. And then I realized that there was a bigger problem, so I started working on solving that, too, and they're like, Yeah, that's what developers do. Congratulations and I'm like, Well, okay, I still need a job\n\nJay 00:42:50:\n\nlike no one's gonna take me serious If I'm just the guy that comes up and goes, Hey, I do podcasting. Come on, let's talk about Python. Um, it and that's where it's It's so frustrating because it's like, How do we fix that? And I've literally had people telling me like\n\nJay 00:43:06:\n\nyou would give really good talks it, like the local conference seen and I'm like, What the hell does that mean? And they're like, Well, you know, some talks were made for conferences that have less than, like 1000 people and then some. Some talks were made for people that are not for people, but for conferences that have, like there, like Pike on Level. And I'm like, Okay, that's stupid. Like I feel like my should be good\n\nMelanie 00:43:30:\n\none of\n\nJay 00:43:30:\n\nthe people\n\nMelanie 00:43:33:\n\nthat\n\nMelanie 00:43:35:\n\nthat's frustrating. That's a frustrating thing that you just described that someone said, like also, I'm gonna go and say That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Like\n\nMelanie 00:43:46:\n\nso. And\n\nMelanie 00:43:50:\n\nbecause a at Piper on not every\n\nMelanie 00:43:55:\n\ntalk is Aquino.\n\nMelanie 00:43:58:\n\nJust just in case anyone hasn't been before, there's either. There's a handful of key notes, but when you pulled off. All the majority of the stocks are in a small room, you know. So\n\nMelanie 00:44:11:\n\ntalk it, Pike. On talking a local conference like you could end up with the same number of people like ends. You know, Northway Python. It's single track. So instead of you know, at high Con, where you have seven different walks, you could go to it and given time slot,\n\nMelanie 00:44:27:\n\nyou know, Northway Python. There's one you're gonna end up with it a pack grim.\n\nJay 00:44:32:\n\nEverybody at that conference paid to hear you talk.\n\nMelanie 00:44:35:\n\nYeah, exactly. It's wonderful. So there's that element. But also\n\nMelanie 00:44:43:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:44:44:\n\nI feel like\n\nMelanie 00:44:49:\n\nyou never know why\n\nMelanie 00:44:51:\n\nyour talk gets turned away from any particular conference. You know, it could be that they got\n\nMelanie 00:44:58:\n\na bunch of different talks on that same topic. Like it just so happens to be that way, you know? I mean, unless is it are you doing close like sleight of hand magic? Is that because I can see I can say that being like meeting a small room\n\nJay 00:45:15:\n\nfor this\n\nMelanie 00:45:15:\n\npresentation, a volunteer\n\nMelanie 00:45:19:\n\nand need a volunteer, and everyone has to be within arm's length of my body\n\nMelanie 00:45:24:\n\nso and I don't know. I mean,\n\nMelanie 00:45:29:\n\nI think in general, in life,\n\nMelanie 00:45:32:\n\nnone of us know we're doing like, ever. So when people sit down and they're like, Well, this thing is good for this circumstance, Like, you know, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:45:43:\n\nnone of us know what we're doing. Just admit it and go on, like with any of the stuff we're doing. We're lucky that we still exist as a species.\n\nJay 00:45:57:\n\nAbsolutely. And I want in this on a way more positive. Note that wherever you are now, So please tell me what's what's next for five up. Is there anything next for five up? Is it just gonna be more of the same? And I'm okay with that, too, cause I'm happy with it.\n\nMelanie 00:46:15:\n\nUm well, first is fixing the very important broken thing.\n\nMelanie 00:46:22:\n\nThis so that that's sexy updates coming at you fast. Um, but there are There are some things that I've wanted to dio um,\n\nMelanie 00:46:32:\n\nSo there's a database that I curate of messages that go out, but you've been also every user has a personal needs, so I can send you my link, and you can put a nice message into my cue and I'll get that mixed in with the other curated ones. Um, and that's like actually a really, really fun and powerful\n\nMelanie 00:46:52:\n\num, feature. What I want to do with that is make it so that you can see your past messages like your past custom ones and break you them, because right now you get it once and you never see it again. So I don't want to reveal them before you get thm. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:47:12:\n\nbecause the surprise is important.\n\nMelanie 00:47:14:\n\nWe like surprised, like delight is in surprise. Unless it's like\n\nMelanie 00:47:20:\n\nsurprise your bankrupt like That's not awesome. But like surprise. I think you're a cool person. Is like is nice, you know, So I don't want to reveal them before you see them, But it's\n\nMelanie 00:47:31:\n\nsome of the custom messages that I've received, and I know that other people have received have been really\n\nMelanie 00:47:41:\n\nlike they can hold you up, you know,\n\nMelanie 00:47:44:\n\num and so if you have the option to go back and say, like, actually, just keep that in my queue all the time, you know some that's me, every\n\nMelanie 00:47:51:\n\nHoward along. That's that's one thing that I've been wanting to dio, um, I want to make it some people can suggest\n\nMelanie 00:47:59:\n\nthings for the general database. And then I can\n\nMelanie 00:48:02:\n\nsay that\n\nMelanie 00:48:03:\n\nyou know, I can allow them to go in because the it's like\n\nMelanie 00:48:08:\n\n350 messages or so that are in there. But they're all ones that I've stood in. You know that I signed and thinker interesting have been there but would be nice to have other people. You know, we have a lot of men, but then it's You do have lots and Jay Peak America's like,\n\nMelanie 00:48:24:\n\nYeah, some people have weird,\n\nMelanie 00:48:27:\n\nweird heroes out there. This is So, um\n\nMelanie 00:48:32:\n\nyou think those air\n\nMelanie 00:48:35:\n\nI I have been wanting to, like, make it a tweet pot or so, but that's like latter. Now I would love to be able to send pictures. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:48:45:\n\nbut that's kind of it's all kind of tricky because it's this weird like, um,\n\nMelanie 00:48:51:\n\nsent through like it sent by email to the SMTP gateway for each of the carriers, you know, for a long period. So there's a little bit of tricking us involved there.\n\nJay 00:49:04:\n\nYou mentioned using Tulio earlier, and we're definitely not gonna get too deep into the weeds here, But the\n\nJay 00:49:12:\n\nTulio a p I has that like SMS thing?\n\nJay 00:49:18:\n\nIs that utilizing the same like email stuff? Or is that actually using, like a phone number type\n\nJay 00:49:25:\n\nwhatever.\n\nMelanie 00:49:29:\n\nI\n\nMelanie 00:49:30:\n\nabandoned twilio straightaway because it's very expensive. Um, especially if you get any number of users that are getting five messages a day legs\n\nMelanie 00:49:43:\n\nI can't afford that is quite expensive. And so but send bread,\n\nMelanie 00:49:48:\n\num, was very affordable. And so I had to kind of do this hack around to figure out how to use the S and P gateways to send The message is so like each carrier has like, a phone number at\n\nMelanie 00:50:01:\n\nsomething at 18 c commune over something like this. So you email the\n\nMelanie 00:50:07:\n\nthat email address, then it comes through a text.\n\nMelanie 00:50:11:\n\nSo that's what I did. And then, interestingly enough, uh, Tulio then acquired sin bread and ensure\n\nMelanie 00:50:19:\n\nthey have not jacked up saying grits, Princes, is this I know. Or maybe I've like, you know, I just got in at the right time, But, um, when I saw that, I was like, Please don't touch me more money. I do this for fun.\n\nMelanie 00:50:33:\n\nI want people to be happy. But like, not like many, many hundreds of dollars are happy.\n\nJay 00:50:39:\n\nAll of my users air happy. I am miserable because I got a 48th of happy.\n\nMelanie 00:50:44:\n\nYeah, I can do that. I can't do that.\n\nMelanie 00:50:47:\n\nSo,\n\nMelanie 00:50:49:\n\nyeah, that's how that works.\n\nJay 00:50:50:\n\nAnd five up is free, right?\n\nMelanie 00:50:53:\n\nYeah.\n\nMelanie 00:50:53:\n\nOne of his act. Yeah.\n\nJay 00:50:57:\n\nUh, though message and data rates may apply. I just saw that at the bottom.\n\nMelanie 00:51:02:\n\nYeah, I did that stuff that\n\nMelanie 00:51:06:\n\ndoesn't say like expensive messages are not happy. I'm pretty sure I shove blood in there.\n\nJay 00:51:11:\n\nAh,\n\nJay 00:51:12:\n\nLissy.\n\nJay 00:51:13:\n\nYes? Make sure you know about your texting and data plan. Expensive messages are not happy.\n\nMelanie 00:51:19:\n\nThey're not. I mean, I have a good database of messages, but, like, I don't know if they cost you 1/4. No, e, I don't know. I don't know about that.\n\nJay 00:51:29:\n\nOh, man, that's too good. All right, well, let's let's get ready to button this up, cause we seven after show to get Teoh. Um, let everybody know once again, if they want to talk to you or if they want to learn more about five up, um, Or if they wanna check out any of your amazing conference talks, where can they do all of those things.\n\nMelanie 00:51:52:\n\nLet's see. So five up is five a pap dot com.\n\nMelanie 00:51:58:\n\nUm, I am on Twitter and, like, everywhere on the Internet almost is. Hello, Melanie C. Um, so twitters where I hang out the most, um, Facebook and I are on a break.\n\nMelanie 00:52:11:\n\nEso don't look for me there. Um,\n\nMelanie 00:52:15:\n\nsee what else?\n\nMelanie 00:52:18:\n\nFive apps on Twitter. I think it's high by Bob the terrible\n\nMelanie 00:52:22:\n\nproject, Mom,\n\nMelanie 00:52:24:\n\nit's on there somewhere. You'll find it just 11.\n\nJay 00:52:27:\n\nSome branding thing will figure that out.\n\nMelanie 00:52:29:\n\nYeah, and then all of my talk, sir, on YouTube. So\n\nMelanie 00:52:35:\n\nif you want, you can keep them all up and compare each, you know, performance to the next and rate them and send it to me. And I'll get real sad about it. Never beautiful.\n\nJay 00:52:47:\n\nI would recommend the ah, the North Bay Python talk.\n\nJay 00:52:51:\n\nUm, about how to get started. To Jingo, it was very, very funny. I heard multiple people, not just me say that it was the best talk of the entire conference, so Oh, yeah. You could definitely got that award.\n\nJay 00:53:07:\n\nUm,\n\nMelanie 00:53:08:\n\nyeah,\n\nMelanie 00:53:09:\n\nit was It was a fun one. It was fun. Everything went wrong. Little preview furry you people out there the panic that you see Israel. It was not staged.\n\nJay 00:53:19:\n\nOh, I remember that. It was Yeah, that was\n\nJay 00:53:24:\n\nI think I triple prepared for my talk. Because of that, I was just like, I know it works. I know everything is good. I'm just going to do it again just to make sure. And also that was their first year doing a conference. So I'm sure, like,\n\nJay 00:53:40:\n\nthe first year versus the third year, though, should they got a lot of bugs? You know, it\n\nMelanie 00:53:45:\n\nwasn't them. It wasn't them. It was me. And I swear to you, I had practiced that talk so many times. And the things that went wrong that you saw had never gone wrong before. Like had not gone run 30 minutes prior. When that happens, been in the green room. It was just, you know, the stars just aligns to really make me vulnerable and sweaty, very sweaty.\n\nJay 00:54:10:\n\nAll right, well, thank you so much for being my esteemed guests on the show\n\nMelanie 00:54:16:\n\non. And well, now\n\nJay 00:54:18:\n\nI love this because I know that in a post Corentin like\n\nJay 00:54:25:\n\nhuge world on fire kind of thing that we're living in right now.\n\nJay 00:54:30:\n\nEventually, we will be able to sit down and\n\nJay 00:54:34:\n\nhave dinner and talk and laugh and do all the things that we did on the show s So I can say for one that this this isn't This isn't a bit. This isn't anything. This is This is 100% Melanie. Every time I have talked to her like I I absolutely love and enjoy our conversations. Um, no, you are also the first person to tell Meteo give a talk, so Oh, yeah, I have to thank you for that\n\nJay 00:55:04:\n\ns o. Thank you so much for being on the show. And\n\nJay 00:55:09:\n\nnow, time for all the stuff that quote unquote pays the bills. Uh, thank you for listening. Everyone out there. I do something different that most podcasters don't. I don't ask you for money. I just ask that as you were listening to this, you weren't like doing 15 other things that you actually listen to. The things that my guest and I were talking about because\n\nJay 00:55:33:\n\nwe get vulnerable. We talk about our experiences when we talk about the things that matter to us and we do it in a way that We hope that it can resonate with other people out there. So\n\nJay 00:55:44:\n\nI don't ask that you raider review the show. I ask that you just listen.\n\nJay 00:55:47:\n\nBut if you feel like you must\n\nJay 00:55:50:\n\ntell me about something that I said that was obviously wrong or stupid, you can do so on Twitter at KJ. Why, Miller? I will ignore it. I will block you. Um, but if it was nice, I'll reply back and say Thanks. Um,\n\nJay 00:56:03:\n\nyeah. If you are a podcast or thinking about getting into podcasting, you need some help with that. You can reach out to me at info at productivity in tech dot com.\n\nJay 00:56:12:\n\nAnd of course, thank you to my uncle. Most people don't realize that when I say that but my uncle in a diorama wallet for the use of his music, a hustler in spite of myself for the Intron Ultra music, I'm only doing this because melodious, smiling at me, and it's like, Well, she did say you have to know people, so I know people. That's how I got my break. So there we go.\n\nJay 00:56:31:\n\nBut that is gonna do it for this week's episode for Melanie and myself. I have been your host, J. Miller, and I hope for at least a tiny bit of our amazing conversation. We have been productive.\n\nJay 00:56:43:\n\nNow. Are you ready, Melanie?

There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more _fatalistic_ and irrational towards things not going according to plan. \n\n### Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?\n*HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW*\n\nIt just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. \n\nI will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.\n\n### Why are you telling us this?\nI'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. \n\nIt took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. \n\n**NOTE**:\n\nI understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.\n\nI can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. \n\n![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/5ArJanyCfxgiY/giphy.gif)", "title": "My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done", "date": "2019-03-25T10:42:00-07:00", "slug": "anxiety-based-gtd", "category": "mental-health", "tags": "['anxiety', 'depression']", "url": "/anxiety-based-gtd", "date_published": "Mon, 25 Mar 2019 10:42:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Mar 25, 2019 10:42 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"base_content": "I've been letting folks know about my [coaching](https://productivityintech.com/coaching) and [editing](https://productivityintech.com/editing) services more and more these days. \n\nIt's been a slow progressing growth. This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. \n\n## Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.\n\nI've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. \n\n100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis **or** they were recommended by the aforementioned person.\n\nWhile I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.\n\nI know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. \n\n## Ways to do this\n### 1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.\n\n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg)\n<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small>\n\nOne of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. \n\nEach of them have their own reach and their own network. \nI've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. \n\nI've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. \n\n### 2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method\nSome relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the [Noguchi Filing Method](https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/). \n\nThe Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. \n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg)\n\nI do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. \n\n### 3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)\nI got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.\n\n> I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)\n\n> Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and \"unicorn\" services.\n\n> I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. \n\n> Here is a list of the services I provide.\n\n> My skills include:\n> - social media\n> - recording videos and screencasts\n> - podcast editing and recording\n> - community management\n> - newsletter publishing\n\n> Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?\n \n> Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.\n \nEveryone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. \n\nI didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.\n\nOne person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.\n\nThe other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. \n\n================\n\nNone of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this _grimy_ feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your \"inner-circle\" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.", "title": "Friends have been my Greatest Asset!", "date": "2019-04-17T09:24:00-07:00",

J.\n\n00:00:20:\n\n Miller here back with a reflection, this time for the 18th of August 2 20.\n\n00:00:29:\n\n And this is a very interesting one.\n\n00:00:32:\n\n This is what we're recording.\n\n00:00:33:\n\n Live on, Twitch.\n\n00:00:35:\n\n If you want to catch that, then you need to make sure following on twitch.\n\n00:00:40:\n\n So we got a lot to talk about.\n\n00:00:42:\n\n Let's just jump right into this and we're going to start with the biggest news.\n\n00:00:49:\n\n Yeah, I got a job.\n\n00:00:55:\n\n I am officially going to be working as a developer advocate for elastic search.\n\n00:01:03:\n\n Um, I believe the last time we talked about this, I was like, Right there.\n\n00:01:08:\n\n I think I had, like, one more interview left, right?\n\n00:01:10:\n\n Just had the final interview and had to negotiate and do all that stuff.\n\n00:01:16:\n\n So we are now developer advocates.\n\n00:01:20:\n\n And for people who have been following the journey of productivity and tech and my personal journey, you'll know that this has been a thing that I have been working towards for the last 56 years.\n\n00:01:38:\n\n So I want to take the second half of this conversation to talk about something that I came up in a conversation that I had with another content creator earlier today.\n\n00:01:53:\n\n As I'm recording this, I'm recording this on the 17 that will come out on the 18th.\n\n00:01:57:\n\n Uh, I was watching this person live stream, and they were talking about wanting to consolidate some of the things that they were doing and put them all under different tiers of support.\n\n00:02:11:\n\n Now, people that are familiar with pit know that one of you want to give me money.\n\n00:02:17:\n\n I'm not going to stop you.\n\n00:02:19:\n\n But I am terrible at asking for money.\n\n00:02:23:\n\n I'm terrible at providing value that I feel warrants people giving me money.\n\n00:02:30:\n\n That's just something that I have always struggled with presenting.\n\n00:02:39:\n\n However, I also feel like the things that I do are valuable.\n\n00:02:47:\n\n And I let people know if you want me to continue to do those things, there has to be some form of value conveyed so that I can continue to pay to do those things Now.\n\n00:03:05:\n\n To me, that looks like some really fun stuff that looks like me, you know, doing open mic stuff with some of my people, some of the people in the community, or just sit there and having conversations with them for hours on end or you re tweeting and showcasing some of the awesome things that they're doing.\n\n00:03:27:\n\n It could be getting on a stream like this and recording.\n\n00:03:31:\n\n You know, my podcast episodes live and doing all these things.\n\n00:03:36:\n\n But there was a conversation in the conversation.\n\n00:03:40:\n\n We talked about the idea of content creation moving ever and ever closer to where everything was expected to be free.\n\n00:03:53:\n\n And as much as I want Teoh complain about that, he's right.\n\n00:04:02:\n\n All my content available for free.\n\n00:04:05:\n\n I don't even my premiums show is free.\n\n00:04:08:\n\n Yes, you got to do something.\n\n00:04:10:\n\n You gotta sign up for my newsletter, which I mean Newsletter will also go out when this goes out.\n\n00:04:15:\n\n So there's that.\n\n00:04:17:\n\n But if you want bonus content, you don't have to give up anything monetarily for it.\n\n00:04:25:\n\n And in a way, this is a good and bad thing, and I think that it's happening for a multitude of reasons.\n\n00:04:39:\n\n So I'm gonna outlined the reasons first, and then I'll explain why I think it's both a good and a bad thing.\n\n00:04:45:\n\n The reason is it's cheaper and cheaper to make content, and the demand for quality content is going down.\n\n00:04:54:\n\n If you look at education traditional If you go back 20 years ago, if you wanted toe learn something, you had to spend good money.\n\n00:05:09:\n\n And depending on what it was, you might have to pay a lot more.\n\n00:05:13:\n\n Programming books were like 60 70 $80 at Barnes and Noble.\n\n00:05:18:\n\n I'm pretty sure they still are.\n\n00:05:21:\n\n Now.\n\n00:05:21:\n\n You can get an online course for 10 bucks a month.\n\n00:05:27:\n\n Something like that.\n\n00:05:28:\n\n You can get hundreds of courses for $10 a month.\n\n00:05:35:\n\n Why, though Well, because it's easier to mill, it's easier to say I'm going to do a thing.\n\n00:05:41:\n\n I'm going to follow the steps and in marketing terms, I'm gonna turkey carve content so that I'm making more and more content easier and easier with less and less effort.\n\n00:05:53:\n\n And here's an example of that.\n\n00:05:56:\n\n I did a coaching course over the weekend with a client of mine, and in that course we talked about a few things over the span of about three hours.\n\n00:06:09:\n\n In that time, I came out with about five different block post topics with screenshots and a video that I could go back and look at and so many other features so many other things that I could use to generate more content already had the video set up.\n\n00:06:31:\n\n I already had.\n\n00:06:32:\n\n The Screenshots already had the links and references.\n\n00:06:34:\n\n I already had the research.\n\n00:06:37:\n\n I could just turn all that stuff out like butter if I wanted to.\n\n00:06:43:\n\n That's what I mean as we're doing things.\n\n00:06:46:\n\n The things that we're doing can be reused and recycled in my talk that I'm going to be giving it pie.\n\n00:06:52:\n\n Gotham I quote a talk that I gave last year as the explainer for why this talk was even necessary as an explainer for why the entire platform that I created was necessary.\n\n00:07:06:\n\n I didn't have to do a bunch of market research.\n\n00:07:08:\n\n I didn't have to dio a bunch of testing, and I didn't have to pay a bunch of money to host on my code, my storage and make everything happen.\n\n00:07:16:\n\n Now I'm paying a little bit, but in the future, that's actually gonna be free as well.\n\n00:07:21:\n\n So, through all of this, I'm able Teoh really expand the scope of what I'm capable of doing for much less so.\n\n00:07:37:\n\n Like I said, it's easier to create content content to be created faster and it requires a lot less work and energy, and the people that are doing it at the highest level are still going to excel because of the calibre of content and the quality of content that they're putting out.\n\n00:07:53:\n\n No.\n\n00:07:55:\n\n Is this a bad thing?\n\n00:07:58:\n\n In short, No.\n\n00:08:00:\n\n No, it's not.\n\n00:08:01:\n\n And here's why.\n\n00:08:05:\n\n As I mentioned earlier, part of what got me hired onto elastic was a skill set that I developed over time and gave away for free.\n\n00:08:18:\n\n So if you look at my salary and it may be a bad way to equate the value of this, but if you go back and you look at what I've been able to get to in terms of a salary over five years, if you look at where I started, I have doubled close to doubled.\n\n00:08:38:\n\n Haven't double quite yet, but I'm close to doubled.\n\n00:08:41:\n\n What I am, what I was making when I started in the tech industry in seven years, I almost doubled what I was able to do, all because of the things that I did for free in my off time.\n\n00:09:00:\n\n So for me to make those things for free was a net positive in my book now, Do I feel like content should be given away for free?\n\n00:09:15:\n\n No.\n\n00:09:17:\n\n Some content?\n\n00:09:17:\n\n Yes, a lot of content.\n\n00:09:19:\n\n No, I don't think ab should be free.\n\n00:09:23:\n\n In general, I think that giving away an app means that you are selling something else.\n\n00:09:29:\n\n You're making that money back some way.\n\n00:09:32:\n\n Unless you're doing what you know a few of my friends have in building a thing to learn about it.\n\n00:09:38:\n\n In fact, most of people that I know that have built a thing just to learn how to do that thing, actually sell that thing that they made that learning until they sell it.\n\n00:09:48:\n\n Because they understand that there was a work that went into it.\n\n00:09:50:\n\n So they want to get value back for the work that they put in.\n\n00:09:53:\n\n That makes sense to me.\n\n00:09:58:\n\n Is it free for me to podcasts?\n\n00:09:59:\n\n No, it's not happy hosting peas.\n\n00:10:03:\n\n Ah, take time away from my family like I am right now.\n\n00:10:06:\n\n I do a lot, Teoh and pay a lot to do the things that I do streaming this.\n\n00:10:19:\n\n I had to buy a whole new computer last year so I could stream because when I tried streaming on my other devices.\n\n00:10:27:\n\n They just crashed and they shut down this whole set up that I have this microphone that I have the audio interface, everything else.\n\n00:10:37:\n\n This is thousands of dollars that I've invested into this.\n\n00:10:41:\n\n Now you would say that those air probably good investments, but they were investments nonetheless, so it doesn't make sense to me to create a thing for free.\n\n00:10:54:\n\n However, I knew strategically what I was doing and that I was going to get paid for it eventually.\n\n00:11:01:\n\n And now I can happily say, like for the last three or four years, productivity in tech podcast has paid for itself.\n\n00:11:09:\n\n We have people that support the show at a high enough level that I don't have to pay any money to host it.\n\n00:11:17:\n\n Between the work that I do outside of the client work that I pick up in all of those things, I'm effectively getting it for free.\n\n00:11:31:\n\n That said to the people who are making something and hoping to give it away for free and still make a living off of it.\n\n00:11:41:\n\n You have to know what the planets my plan was to do the bed podcast for free in hopes that one day someone would pay me to podcast for them.\n\n00:11:55:\n\n And like I said, I'm not there yet, But I'm hoping that soon enough that will be happening.\n\n00:11:59:\n\n Now I'm in a position to where that can possibly happen.\n\n00:12:07:\n\n There are a lot of people out there that are making content for free that don't have a monetization strategy.\n\n00:12:17:\n\n There are a lot of people out there that are doing something for free and hoping to turn it into something that they can get big enough on and make a bunch of money off of eventually.\n\n00:12:31:\n\n Here's what I have to say to those people.\n\n00:12:35:\n\n It is much easier to look at what you have.\n\n00:12:42:\n\n Look at the people it brings value to and ask them to support your work now, not with the promise that you will do anything outside of what you're already doing, but just for the sake of supporting your existing work.\n\n00:13:05:\n\n It is much easier to ask them now for support, and you'll most likely receive some form of support from those people that get value from what you're doing.\n\n00:13:16:\n\n It may not be a ton, but it may be a little long term listeners.\n\n00:13:22:\n\n The pit will know that there used to be a Facebook group that had thousands of people in it, that we're all part of the productivity and tech Facebook group.\n\n00:13:31:\n\n I gave up that group to start a small private community where people had to pay to get access to it.\n\n00:13:41:\n\n It didn't promise them any bells and whistles.\n\n00:13:42:\n\n All it promised them was a chat room where they could connect with me on a regular basis.\n\n00:13:46:\n\n And since then that community is now free again.\n\n00:13:49:\n\n And the only people that really talking it are the people that still give me money to support what I'm doing.\n\n00:13:58:\n\n The people that signed up for that there were a total of eight people, and I'm still friends with all of those eight people.\n\n00:14:10:\n\n Those eight people provided 800 times more revenue, more profit and on a budget that made it a lot easier for me to do podcasting, then a group of thousands of people who were listening Teoh the pope, reading the posts and liking and doing all that stuff, and it was so much easier to please those eight people than it was to create, engaging and enlightening content for 2000 people, and that's why I'm saying, Look at your existing audience, figure out how much value you're bringing to them and ask, and if they can't do it, they can't do it.\n\n00:15:03:\n\n But I think the reason that people are rushing to the bottom for free content is because they have to rely on a numbers game that is unfair to creators.\n\n00:15:18:\n\n They're having to push hundreds of thousands of people consuming their content.\n\n00:15:23:\n\n They have to create content instead of creating the content that they want to create in the content that they enjoy creating.\n\n00:15:29:\n\n They have to now make content with the thought of.\n\n00:15:33:\n\n Is this going to generate an audience?\n\n00:15:36:\n\n Is this going to generate traffic?\n\n00:15:38:\n\n Is this going to make what I'm doing appealing to advertisers?\n\n00:15:49:\n\n I don't like the direction that we're going in, and I don't want people to feel like productivity And tech is Go is helping promote that kind of business model.\n\n00:16:12:\n\n I said a long time ago it won't have ads on it.\n\n00:16:15:\n\n The podcast itself won't have, adds.\n\n00:16:18:\n\n The newsletter might have ads.\n\n00:16:20:\n\n I might give shoutouts, but I'm not gonna do ads.\n\n00:16:25:\n\n My website might have ads.\n\n00:16:27:\n\n The website.\n\n00:16:28:\n\n I'm sorry, However, right now I'm not trying to align myself any particular pathway that has me selling clicks for pennies.\n\n00:16:42:\n\n I'm not in the business of selling clicks for pennies.\n\n00:16:45:\n\n I'm just not.\n\n00:16:46:\n\n I don't have time for that.\n\n00:16:47:\n\n I don't have the energy for that.\n\n00:16:49:\n\n If I were doing a podcast with someone else, there might be a different conversation.\n\n00:16:55:\n\n But in regards to the pit podcast, it is not in the business of trading clicks or listens for pins.\n\n00:17:06:\n\n However, productivity in tech has always and will always be my playground.\n\n00:17:13:\n\n It will be the thing that I do for fun.\n\n00:17:15:\n\n It will be the thing that I do because I enjoy doing it.\n\n00:17:18:\n\n And I hope that over monetization of a platform that I am able to encourage, inspire and enlightened folks on a pathway to be more productive in whatever it is they're doing.\n\n00:17:33:\n\n That is the goal of productivity intact with the business, the podcast, the brand, all of those things.\n\n00:17:41:\n\n I hope that I've been doing that.\n\n00:17:44:\n\n If I haven't, please call me out, and I will try to course correct bunts.\n\n00:17:51:\n\n Just because I give this away for free doesn't mean that your information is being sold.\n\n00:18:01:\n\n It doesn't mean that I'm tracking you.\n\n00:18:04:\n\n In fact, I have aligned the podcast with organizations and companies and hosting that doesn't track.\n\n00:18:15:\n\n They track information for me.\n\n00:18:19:\n\n And while I will peak at it from time to time, that those numbers don't go anywhere, they don't go to anybody.\n\n00:18:29:\n\n And the people that are hosting it aren't using it.\n\n00:18:31:\n\n They're not selling that information.\n\n00:18:33:\n\n They can.\n\n00:18:33:\n\n It's our assess its It's like MP threes, and that's why I don't have, you know, adds auto generated into this show and all those things.\n\n00:18:41:\n\n And there's again nothing wrong with the people that are doing that.\n\n00:18:46:\n\n I am choosing not to do that.\n\n00:18:49:\n\n So this has been my little rant in that area.\n\n00:18:52:\n\n Like I said, I don't really have any particular point.\n\n00:18:57:\n\n I just want you also think about where content creation is going.\n\n00:19:06:\n\n I see a lot of people now that we're creating what's called premium content where you can't even get access to the basic level of content without paying for it.\n\n00:19:14:\n\n That's a very interesting model.\n\n00:19:16:\n\n You have to have a large audience beforehand to do that.\n\n00:19:21:\n\n I think it will work for some.\n\n00:19:24:\n\n I don't think it'll work for me, but I am excited to see that people are still trying to figure out how they can create content that is scalable monetarily but also protective of the consumer's rights.\n\n00:19:47:\n\n All right, so let's wrap this up.\n\n00:19:49:\n\n What we got coming up next next week, I have an interview with someone that I've been listening to their podcast since like Day One, they come out of the same camp is like Tom Merritt and those folks.\n\n00:20:03:\n\n It's not going to be a technical interview.\n\n00:20:04:\n\n It's gonna be a really fun conversation that I had with someone that I've been wanting to talk to you for years.\n\n00:20:11:\n\n So I am stoked that it finally got toe happen.\n\n00:20:14:\n\n I can't wait to go back and edit it, because I get to listen to it again.\n\n00:20:18:\n\n You know, that's that's like the best part of doing these shows is that I get to record them, some having the conversation as it's happening organically.\n\n00:20:25:\n\n Then I get to go back and listen to it before everyone else does, and then afterwards I gotta listen to it again just to make sure I didn't screw anything up.\n\n00:20:31:\n\n And every time I listen to it, every time I hear the conversation or as it's happening, I pick up on something new and I learned something new.\n\n00:20:39:\n\n So it's like it's super awesome to have opportunities like that coming out.\n\n00:20:46:\n\n So, yeah, I'm gonna like I said, I have that interview coming out next week.\n\n00:20:50:\n\n I am doing the last interviews for the rest of the year, this week and next week.\n\n00:20:56:\n\n So I get to kind of relax going into this new role where I'm only having to create content for the reflection side of things and not for the actual like, Oh, we're doing a podcast interview thing where I got to bring people in.\n\n00:21:13:\n\n I might do some more interviews with people if I want to, but there's no requirement to.\n\n00:21:19:\n\n And if I do, I'll let you know, and we'll figure it out on all those things.\n\n00:21:25:\n\n So that's gonna be it for this reflection and ran a little bit longer because I started rambling people watching live.\n\n00:21:34:\n\n Thank you for hanging out.\n\n00:21:36:\n\n I had to have the fan running behind me because I was sweating something terrible.\n\n00:21:41:\n\n But thank you to the live audience listening.\n\n00:21:45:\n\n If you want to be a part of that live audience, you can follow me on switch.\n\n00:21:47:\n\n I always announce what?\n\n00:21:49:\n\n I'm going live and you can follow me on Twitter.\n\n00:21:54:\n\n That's where I do a lot of those announcements.\n\n00:21:56:\n\n If you're looking at my website right now, KJ why Miller?\n\n00:21:59:\n\n Thank you so much for that.\n\n00:22:00:\n\n Of course, you can catch all the things happening for productivity and tech it productivity intact dot com You can follow them on Twitter, prod, underscore and underscore Tech And last but not least thank you to an eight year old Wally for the use of his music hustler.\n\n00:22:15:\n\n In spite of myself for the intro and Outro folks, I'm excited.\n\n00:22:21:\n\n The rest of the year is gonna be a legit.\n\n00:22:23:\n\n It's gonna be awesome.\n\n00:22:24:\n\n I cannot wait for all the things that I get to do in this new role and how that's point to benefit me as a podcaster so I can bring that value back to this show.\n\n00:22:39:\n\n I am stuff I'm pumped That's going to do it for this week.\n\n00:22:44:\n\n I hope we've been productive.\n\n00:22:46:\n\n I'm Jay Miller.\n\n00:22:47:\n\n Thanks for

everybody?\n\n00:00:18:\n\n J.\n\n00:00:19:\n\n Miller here, back again with the Productivity in Tech.\n\n00:00:22:\n\n Podcast.\n\n00:00:23:\n\n This is the show where I sit down with somebody in the tech space that is killing it and doing absolutely amazing.\n\n00:00:30:\n\n And we try to figure out, like the nugget, the little thing, that it is like the key to their not success but the key to their day to day sustainability and like maintaining that high level of excellence.\n\n00:00:49:\n\n And this week is like every other week I have another great guest for you coming from Minnesota.\n\n00:00:57:\n\n I just defended everybody in the Midwest.\n\n00:01:02:\n\n Didn't know.\n\n00:01:04:\n\n Thes developer advocate for mongo db.\n\n00:01:09:\n\n You can catch him on Twitter, Tic Tac or its Which the one.\n\n00:01:13:\n\n The only joke.\n\n00:01:14:\n\n Carlson.\n\n00:01:14:\n\n Joe, how are you doing today?\n\n00:01:16:\n\n Oh, my gosh.\n\n00:01:16:\n\n This is the best intro I've ever gotten.\n\n00:01:20:\n\n I'm blushing.\n\n00:01:21:\n\n I'm doing so good.\n\n00:01:23:\n\n Thank you for asking.\n\n00:01:23:\n\n And I'm just so but I'm just glad to be here.\n\n00:01:26:\n\n It's awesome.\n\n00:01:27:\n\n Thanks for having me.\n\n00:01:28:\n\n Absolutely.\n\n00:01:29:\n\n We we actually met through a mutual friend of ours shot out to April.\n\n00:01:33:\n\n Uh, I know you're listening because you you send me a DEA or an email every time something.\n\n00:01:39:\n\n So Hey, what's up?\n\n00:01:41:\n\n But they keep doing that, by the way.\n\n00:01:44:\n\n But ah, April was like, Hey, both of your awesome You two should connect and then I do a podcast.\n\n00:01:52:\n\n I'm sure you said you have a podcast, Joe as well.\n\n00:01:54:\n\n We can talk about that a little bit later.\n\n00:01:56:\n\n I don't personally, but mongo DB does help people do it.\n\n00:02:00:\n\n That's cool.\n\n00:02:01:\n\n That's cool.\n\n00:02:02:\n\n Eso were like, Really?\n\n00:02:03:\n\n Hey, your link had 30 minutes.\n\n00:02:05:\n\n My link had an hour.\n\n00:02:06:\n\n So I was going to do everything that I could to talk to you longer.\n\n00:02:09:\n\n So I just content coming onto a podcast.\n\n00:02:13:\n\n How does it feel?\n\n00:02:15:\n\n Oh, great.\n\n00:02:16:\n\n I love women apart.\n\n00:02:16:\n\n Guys so fun.\n\n00:02:17:\n\n It's like, uh, yeah, this is so great.\n\n00:02:20:\n\n Yeah, I love it to you like let's trapped like great.\n\n00:02:23:\n\n Let's just do the chat on my podcast.\n\n00:02:27:\n\n Perfect.\n\n00:02:28:\n\n I'm on board this.\n\n00:02:29:\n\n Do its we've never met.\n\n00:02:31:\n\n Let's share everything that we dio to the recording it for Everybody cools.\n\n00:02:36:\n\n Yes, let's do that since I did you love it.\n\n00:02:39:\n\n This was speaking of what you do.\n\n00:02:40:\n\n Let's let's jump into that.\n\n00:02:42:\n\n What is what is a day in the life of a Dev Avocado for mongo DB.\n\n00:02:47:\n\n It's, like, different for everyone.\n\n00:02:48:\n\n And I'm sure you've talked to 10 of Dev advocates to for, um I'm only off totally.\n\n00:02:55:\n\n Yeah, and like I've done, I've been technically for, like, large e commerce sites.\n\n00:03:00:\n\n Um, and this is my first time doing developer advocacy, And I've been doing for about a year now full time.\n\n00:03:07:\n\n Um, and it's different.\n\n00:03:09:\n\n Okay, so I want to paint a picture about, like, what I do to kind of accept the pits.\n\n00:03:13:\n\n Don't like the tone a little bit.\n\n00:03:15:\n\n And so I've been working about dive, like all of us working remote since Covad lockdowns happening.\n\n00:03:20:\n\n But I've been doing it since the beginning.\n\n00:03:22:\n\n It's like a remote, first kind of tick position.\n\n00:03:25:\n\n Um, yeah.\n\n00:03:26:\n\n So I'm like, home alone a lot, if you like, wildly oscillates between, like being alone and not talking anyone for weeks on end.\n\n00:03:33:\n\n And then like going to a conference or speaking virtually and like, having lots and lots of conversations all at once.\n\n00:03:39:\n\n Um, and I feel like recently too.\n\n00:03:42:\n\n People don't know you're listening to this to like, I've been posting a lot of tic tac videos recently and like that's been weirdly shaping my what?\n\n00:03:54:\n\n I've been doing the data date of my life a lot, which is so weird.\n\n00:03:57:\n\n I felt so stupid saying that I feel so stupid because it's I mean, I don't really do that dance that make, like, NJ.\n\n00:04:03:\n\n You've seen a couple of videos.\n\n00:04:04:\n\n They're just, like, fine trying look like fun programming jokes, Um, but stuff I feel horribly anxious about, um and I tried to, like, put that on the internet.\n\n00:04:14:\n\n Um, but I know what the date My day today?\n\n00:04:17:\n\n I don't know.\n\n00:04:18:\n\n I'm on social media lot.\n\n00:04:19:\n\n I do programming as much that possibly can.\n\n00:04:21:\n\n I do twits trimming every Friday and a mongo db twitch channel.\n\n00:04:25:\n\n Um, and I speak it like maybe 12 maybe three conferences a week.\n\n00:04:30:\n\n She's and then that you're trying to get podcast.\n\n00:04:33:\n\n It's been weird.\n\n00:04:33:\n\n And like Kobe has been a game changer to like, Ah, I feel like I don't know, It's so it's so I'm agency like like my day to day goes here.\n\n00:04:43:\n\n But obviously I was traveling to conferences a lot, and if you like I've been like everything is moving online and trying to understand what online space looks like for us.\n\n00:04:53:\n\n And I think that that's like I am.\n\n00:04:56:\n\n I don't think we're gonna be like, going back to like what we had before and trying to figure out with how everyone's gonna learning and growing sharing without in person conferences.\n\n00:05:07:\n\n I don't know when we get those really long and winded.\n\n00:05:10:\n\n And I don't think I answered your question all but denies.\n\n00:05:13:\n\n Parade is so fun.\n\n00:05:14:\n\n Thank you for asking s So I will say the one thing you talked about, Like just kind of learning.\n\n00:05:23:\n\n I I will tell you the first, and this doesn't affect you in any way.\n\n00:05:28:\n\n I guess this is me.\n\n00:05:29:\n\n I'm not bragging or something.\n\n00:05:30:\n\n Um, I love Yeah, the first database architecture that I ever used in like actual, like live setting was mongo.\n\n00:05:40:\n\n So my manga devi was I like I am on record saying I hate, like, weird like sequel.\n\n00:05:51:\n\n Tire likes design like I want something that I can read.\n\n00:05:55:\n\n I want something that I can like, just dive into and be like, That's what I need.\n\n00:05:59:\n\n Give me that and not have to think about insane commands on and as totally uses python like I became well versed in pie mongo and and just just jumping into that world early.\n\n00:06:15:\n\n And I could tell that, like, even from the jump like Mongo, DB has always had this community first kind of approach where it's like, Hey, look, here's this thing that you can get for free with no support that also has this gigantic like documentation library that has, like, ah, lot of communities stuff a lot of community involvement or you can pay us and get access to all of the same things.\n\n00:06:42:\n\n But then, if you need to call us, you can kind also just do that Totally.\n\n00:06:46:\n\n Yeah, exactly what we love here and that you like, got it among you to be first.\n\n00:06:49:\n\n And I think that's a super common experience to is like, Yeah, I think just like the database model makes more sense with, like, programmer, like we're saving things as objects anyways, like saving it as an object makes so much sense.\n\n00:07:01:\n\n Yeah, especially when you're first getting the programming and think that that, like, yeah, I understand normalisation of treat it like legacy databases of soberly so hard I'm gonna tow I know the guy who does the development for the pie Mongo driver.\n\n00:07:15:\n\n I'm a to tell him how much you you flip work with stuff, too, if he's awesome.\n\n00:07:18:\n\n Um, but, uh, yeah, we'll have that.\n\n00:07:22:\n\n Like, I feel like we're I don't know.\n\n00:07:27:\n\n I think we're trying to, like listen to developers more and more and more.\n\n00:07:31:\n\n And I think you're right.\n\n00:07:31:\n\n We've had this, like reputation for being like, very developer friendly.\n\n00:07:36:\n\n I think that we're we're trying to be, like, better than anyone else habits, you know?\n\n00:07:39:\n\n I mean, I think I don't know.\n\n00:07:42:\n\n It's it's hard.\n\n00:07:43:\n\n There's like dopers were like a fickle species were you know, we, uh, love new shiny things were, you know, were there's always new stuff coming out.\n\n00:07:52:\n\n You know, you can't you can't sell something that developed, doesn't want it doesn't work, right.\n\n00:07:57:\n\n Like it has to be like organically something helpers are one actually used, um, which is so important?\n\n00:08:03:\n\n Well, it was awesome.\n\n00:08:05:\n\n I think the thing with that, though, is your developers are starting to change, I think, as fewer and fewer developers air coming out of like M i t.\n\n00:08:17:\n\n And Caltech with a knocking a master's in computer science.\n\n00:08:21:\n\n And now it's more like, Hey, I went to this coding boot camp because I was tired of being a bartender on, and that attitude shift has, in my opinion, been great because yes, I'm coming from a position of like college dropout turned military.\n\n00:08:37:\n\n Better in turned like I program to solve the problems in my day to day job, and now it's like I'm ready to make that transition after, like, a decade of doing that to being like, Okay, I can call myself professional developer type.\n\n00:08:55:\n\n What does that look like for me?\n\n00:08:56:\n\n What is the intersection between managing communities and talking and getting people on shows to ask these questions and then also writing code from time to time, which I try to do every day?\n\n00:09:07:\n\n But it's hard.\n\n00:09:09:\n\n Even developers don't write code every day.\n\n00:09:11:\n\n It's hard.\n\n00:09:11:\n\n Yeah, it's hard to do every day, so yeah, and I think one of the things that you've done really well is you are meeting the group of people where they are like you are, and I think a lot of developer advocates now arm or more like not talking in a boardroom.\n\n00:09:31:\n\n But talking at, like from a bar stool or talking from, you know, outside it, like in the hallway track of ah, conference.\n\n00:09:40:\n\n And now, like talking on Twitter and take talking.\n\n00:09:44:\n\n And now it's which is even becoming a bigger thing where these conversations aren't being had in the quote unquote professional areas.\n\n00:09:51:\n\n You're making these completely like personal like curated, feed algorithmic like hallways, where you can talk tech with the people who are seeking toe.\n\n00:10:05:\n\n Learn from the folks like what you're doing, I was told.\n\n00:10:08:\n\n I told agree, and I think you nailed it, too.\n\n00:10:10:\n\n Like I think.\n\n00:10:11:\n\n Traditionally, I think that's a couple of years ago.\n\n00:10:13:\n\n Like people go in and go like, Yeah, I suit up and go talk to a CTO of a company and try to explain to him for the sales deck of why it works and I love it.\n\n00:10:23:\n\n I feel the same way to click.\n\n00:10:25:\n\n So I was.\n\n00:10:26:\n\n I was the technical instructor at a dual boot camp in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n00:10:29:\n\n So, like, I have, like a really stop spot.\n\n00:10:31:\n\n My heart flick developers.\n\n00:10:32:\n\n I think that was awesome.\n\n00:10:33:\n\n No, like seeing people like jump in.\n\n00:10:35:\n\n Um, I think a lot of people like it's sexy and cool to, like, be talking about the, um, like, the latest greatest things are advanced use cases for mongo db.\n\n00:10:45:\n\n But, like, the thing is, 99% of users don't really care about that.\n\n00:10:49:\n\n Like, most people just want to know, Like, how do I put data in and get it out?\n\n00:10:53:\n\n You know what I mean?\n\n00:10:53:\n\n Or like, how do we get started?\n\n00:10:55:\n\n Or like, how do I want to feel like I'm listening to?\n\n00:10:58:\n\n You know what I mean?\n\n00:10:58:\n\n Or like, I'm gonna be welcome here.\n\n00:11:01:\n\n I think I don't know it.\n\n00:11:04:\n\n I feel like a lot of dope, Ravic, see is like, still kind of starting with that.\n\n00:11:08:\n\n I get the appeal of it, too, because I I want to be known as, like, the smartest guy about this thing.\n\n00:11:14:\n\n But no one really cares about that stuff.\n\n00:11:16:\n\n No one cares who cares or find, like, try to tell you about this advance use case like, but like, no one's there yet.\n\n00:11:21:\n\n Like that.\n\n00:11:22:\n\n Just, like doesn't go anywhere.\n\n00:11:24:\n\n I don't know.\n\n00:11:24:\n\n I think it in, like for this stuff I'm doing to.\n\n00:11:27:\n\n I won't be making things that like I wish I had and I was learning program, you know?\n\n00:11:32:\n\n I mean, like, I don't want to read a book or like, I don't know, I can't read I just getting but e just like Is It is a advanced techno mumbo jumbo of boring And I felt like I was like, I felt stupid reading It's and I felt defeated.\n\n00:11:49:\n\n Um, I just wanted to feel like, listen to and heard and, like, encouraged, like, keep learning even though it's hard, you know?\n\n00:11:55:\n\n I mean, absolutely.\n\n00:11:57:\n\n And I think that that's like some of the videos that you've put out on tech talk really do show that, like the junior developer releasing his first commit.\n\n00:12:06:\n\n It's kind of like OK, I could get fired right now.\n\n00:12:11:\n\n I mean, that's really that's what got me into the idea of productivity as a person who works in the tech space was lying coming from a military background when you're like I can't get fired, Yeah, like it's not here for me to die than to get fired in the military.\n\n00:12:29:\n\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:12:31:\n\n Then going to a position where it's like, OK, they've given me zero instruction.\n\n00:12:36:\n\n All I have are like my job.\n\n00:12:39:\n\n Describe right.\n\n00:12:40:\n\n If you mess with the lending rules, you're gone.\n\n00:12:42:\n\n Exactly.\n\n00:12:43:\n\n Yeah.\n\n00:12:43:\n\n And, yeah, just coming into like this weird.\n\n00:12:46:\n\n Like, how do I How do I jump over that hill and even even wanting to get into a new career like now again, When you have someone that's like a bartender, it's like, Okay, the worst thing that I can do is give someone a really bad drink.\n\n00:12:58:\n\n Yeah, Or maybe just let somebody jump across the barn, My bartender for an hour.\n\n00:13:02:\n\n But this is surely bad, too.\n\n00:13:04:\n\n But that's true.\n\n00:13:05:\n\n That's true.\n\n00:13:05:\n\n It's frowned upon, but yeah, but it's a vandal world.\n\n00:13:09:\n\n It's fine.\n\n00:13:09:\n\n Exactly.\n\n00:13:10:\n\n And now it's like if you're working at, like, one of these, like Fang companies or our company that is dealing with databases.\n\n00:13:18:\n\n You know, people store important stuff in databases when data leaks, gets exudes data.\n\n00:13:25:\n\n Yeah, employees and I sit there and think about like, ah, a few weeks back from recording this, there was like the big T mobile like incident, and it where someone was saying like, Oh, yeah, someone like released on, uh, committed something and it wasn't ready, and it like crash the system and I was like, Ooh, that's a bad day.\n\n00:13:44:\n\n And at the end of the day, it just turned out that, like a couple of low bouncers like failed is a coldly exactly or someone like published a semi colon wrong and I config file or something.\n\n00:13:56:\n\n It exactly crash the load balancer.\n\n00:13:59:\n\n Yeah, and like I've crashed a couple sites, I haven't crashed anything huge.\n\n00:14:03:\n\n Um, and it's OK, Yeah, it's okay, but it doesn't feel OK And even, like even thinking back in the times of crashed production sites, I like, I like cringe, and I hate myself and, like, brings definitely like it's like it's hard to think about.\n\n00:14:17:\n\n It still hurts, you know?\n\n00:14:18:\n\n Um, I don't know.\n\n00:14:20:\n\n And I feel like we just like, is an industry like greater forgiveness for a junior.\n\n00:14:23:\n\n Developers like ourselves from that stuff.\n\n00:14:25:\n\n Um, of course, like crashing productions operate, you want to do it.\n\n00:14:30:\n\n If you do it twice.\n\n00:14:31:\n\n Probably bad.\n\n00:14:33:\n\n That's bad.\n\n00:14:33:\n\n You probably don't do the same thing twice your master privileges about what had been revoked exactly.\n\n00:14:38:\n\n Yeah, you probably like It's like maybe should rethink things at that point, but it like once or like messing things up eso like specifically to with that, Like so I just published a tick talk About, Like how, Like I remember, I was just like, thinking back about, like my first commit like, professional commit with a team of senior engineers reviewing my code like I'm afraid it was.\n\n00:14:59:\n\n And then even like as a boot camp instructor, like seeing my students met the PR's for review and, like just you can just feel the anxiety.\n\n00:15:07:\n\n You know, there's like a lot of anxiety about it.\n\n00:15:09:\n\n I A I just really In general, I think we just need more empathy in our industry, not me.\n\n00:15:15:\n\n And I just I think we just have, like, a lot of its words.\n\n00:15:20:\n\n It's scary Field, and I think you're feeling of Fear.\n\n00:15:23:\n\n Two.\n\n00:15:24:\n\n It's like everyone every feels that in that sex that's sex that's actually do that ourselves.\n\n00:15:30:\n\n I don't know.\n\n00:15:31:\n\n I feel like for the longest time developers, and I would even say like developer advocates like it was almost like that stereotypical cinematic prison mentality of like All right, I just jumped in.\n\n00:15:45:\n\n I gotta find the biggest and baddest person in the room and like clock.\n\n00:15:48:\n\n Yeah, just take down.\n\n00:15:51:\n\n I feel like that was when I first got in detect That was like me.\n\n00:15:56:\n\n Like Okay, what's the biggest problem that our company has right now?\n\n00:15:59:\n\n And I'm gonna solve it like, Yeah, I had minutes just to show that I'm the badass in the area.\n\n00:16:04:\n\n And at the end of the day, it was like you just brought the entire network down like, yeah, why minded types that leads to try Exactly.\n\n00:16:15:\n\n I think that there's something about advocating for all levels of development, which is which is something that, you know, we've been preaching the good word of Mongo, You know, this last 20 minutes.\n\n00:16:28:\n\n But yeah, more than anything, I think the attitude of I would say, like the postmodern developer advocate, is one that is like, Hey, look, at the end of the day, it's the people that air righting the code that are going to be making the biggest of these decisions because if they're using a tool that they don't like, it's it's gonna release and bad quality.\n\n00:16:56:\n\n So now, instead of talking to the CTO about how something can, you know, be good for their our ally and reduce.\n\n00:17:05:\n\n It'll increase you to reduce your workload by like, 80%.\n\n00:17:09:\n\n It's like you just say you were gonna fire, like, eight out of 10 people in the room that that's not what people want to hear.\n\n00:17:16:\n\n Uh, and instead, you're just like, Hey, look, I get it.\n\n00:17:20:\n\n Being a developer is hard.\n\n00:17:23:\n\n The tool is designed to make it a little bit easier.\n\n00:17:25:\n\n And I'm gonna show you how Yeah, and totally no.\n\n00:17:29:\n\n And I'm not gonna waste your time because I'm doing it on Twitch or I'm doing it on like a YouTube video.\n\n00:17:34:\n\n That way, if you can tell from like five minutes in that, it's not for you.\n\n00:17:38:\n\n You know you got to do is close the tab.\n\n00:17:40:\n\n You don't have to, like, sit there awkwardly in the boardroom like, uh oh.\n\n00:17:45:\n\n Told Wade, sit there like a conference and be like All right, well, this guy has a keynote.\n\n00:17:49:\n\n So let me check my email real quick.\n\n00:17:53:\n\n Yeah, No, absolutely.\n\n00:17:55:\n\n Usually right in, like there's a 1,000,000 different databases up there.\n\n00:17:58:\n\n There's a 1,000,000 different Web apple.\n\n00:18:00:\n\n There is a little different frame frameworks you could possibly use.\n\n00:18:02:\n\n It's like and I do the whole time to like, I'll spend like something a pop up on hacker news or read it.\n\n00:18:08:\n\n I'll spend, like, 10 seconds looking at it and then all the side, whether I want it like if it's worth my time.\n\n00:18:13:\n\n But it was like, J your nights Time is super valuable.\n\n00:18:17:\n\n I might go and, like I'm not going to spend my time frantically learning every new shining he's object that comes out like that's That's not sustainable or like even that's a terrible idea for just like our time, you know?\n\n00:18:29:\n\n I mean, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:18:31:\n\n E Think you and I would be like, picky about what were learning and like, making sure it's worth of time both, like for a career should be even just like for fun, like I'm not gonna learn something that's, like, sucks to use and boring and buggy, and it's doesn't do anything for me, you know?\n\n00:18:46:\n\n I mean, I'm not spending things like actually helpful I want to use.\n\n00:18:51:\n\n And even with that, like you can see, like the stuff, the stuff that we have to use this stuff that we're like Ari Well, I mean, our system runs on a W s so right.\n\n00:19:02:\n\n Like I have to know how boto three works as a python developer working in AWS.\n\n00:19:08:\n\n I have to at least have an idea of that structure.\n\n00:19:13:\n\n No, I I mean, one of the things that I do for like, my side business that is productivity in tech is I do transcriptions for podcasters, for content creators and like all that stuff and well, I think that that's awesome.\n\n00:19:28:\n\n They're people that are just like, yeah, I don't want to give Amazon my money and it's like, Okay, I totally respect that.\n\n00:19:35:\n\n However, like now I have to go learn she see us and then I or I have to go learn like IBM Watson, which nobody wants to do, O r.\n\n00:19:45:\n\n I have to, like, sign up and give half of the money that I'm making toe like some third party that down the road is literally just using aws.\n\n00:19:54:\n\n So in my mind, I'm like now I have to learn three different schemers Teoh do the exact same thing because one person doesn't want to use the architecture and there perfectly validated for that.\n\n00:20:07:\n\n However, the only thing that I can do on my end is say, Well, where is the common denominator?\n\n00:20:13:\n\n You know, when it comes to like bringing it back to, like, database stuff?\n\n00:20:17:\n\n One of the things I love in Python a sequel Alchemy because it's it's designed to be the what are you using using Post Press.\n\n00:20:24:\n\n Okay, we got that Using that's equal.\n\n00:20:26:\n\n Okay, we got that.\n\n00:20:27:\n\n Yeah, unlike in the process of like, trying to build that for transcription tools because I'm tired of having to remember what scheme I'm in and like, Okay, how do I How do I fetch alternatives for GCS versus AWS?\n\n00:20:42:\n\n And I know for a lot of people, they're like, I don't know what that means, but it's one of those things were like, You get so frustrated and just fighting with the tools that you're just like if someone came to me and was like, Hey, we understand that your tool suck.\n\n00:20:56:\n\n Here's a way that you can use this and not wanna pull.\n\n00:21:00:\n\n You know, your luxurious locks out in a single day.\n\n00:21:04:\n\n Yeah, I'm just, like, sign me up.\n\n00:21:06:\n\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n00:21:08:\n\n I will do that.\n\n00:21:09:\n\n You nailed it like I think, a part that a lot of people don't look at, especially with like cloud architecture like we're looking at like like is like developer time and, like our time tends to be the most expensive part of any project these days, like infrastructure in like the tools or uses fractional costs to our time.\n\n00:21:29:\n\n And I think it's developers like we don't I don't know.\n\n00:21:31:\n\n I feel like a lot of times and companies like our time is not respected by managers and the like.\n\n00:21:37:\n\n Product leads to Flake, but I think it's developers.\n\n00:21:40:\n\n We consider that I think we need to be advocating for a sells for, to use tools that, like makes sense and I respect our time.\n\n00:21:46:\n\n You know, we're like we could get done quickly.\n\n00:21:48:\n\n We're just easy to use and agree.\n\n00:21:50:\n\n Like if you have to use something if you have to learn three new schemes and bringing products to get a thing done like okay, that's okay.\n\n00:21:56:\n\n But like, I don't love that you're looking at like weighing the pros and cons of using things that you're already already know to use or like, easier to you know, I mean, I think that's important.\n\n00:22:07:\n\n Well, I think I deserve it I think it's good that there's options now, which is is the best part.\n\n00:22:14:\n\n But I think in that advocates should be listening to the user.\n\n00:22:24:\n\n I think I know.\n\n00:22:25:\n\n I don't know.\n\n00:22:26:\n\n Why did you send this?\n\n00:22:28:\n\n Maybe it was.\n\n00:22:28:\n\n I'm jumping on Twitter now because I'm a horrible podcaster.\n\n00:22:31:\n\n Um, no, that's great.\n\n00:22:33:\n\n Joe Rogan, that sequoia dozens that I'm sooner, Right?\n\n00:22:39:\n\n Exactly.\n\n00:22:40:\n\n Exactly.\n\n00:22:41:\n\n I think there was, Ah, blawg posts that you you responded to on Twitter earlier today.\n\n00:22:47:\n\n That was our early in last couple days, I guess talking about the idea of, like, look, customers don't care about that cool trick that you did to make your code work because I care about, like, the efficiency of your They They kind of care about the efficiency and more about the performance.\n\n00:23:03:\n\n You care about how clean your code is elegant.\n\n00:23:06:\n\n Your solution Now, abstract er code was all the air out is doesn't solve my problem in the end of the day.\n\n00:23:13:\n\n Like that's what's importantly.\n\n00:23:14:\n\n Okay.\n\n00:23:14:\n\n Hey, can I can I use this?\n\n00:23:16:\n\n Doesn't solve my problem.\n\n00:23:18:\n\n Okay, Cool.\n\n00:23:18:\n\n Sign me up and I feel like more and more advocates are starting to understand that more than anything, they're starting to actually try to collect those problem points.\n\n00:23:30:\n\n They're like, OK, this was working for you up until this point.\n\n00:23:36:\n\n Yeah, What did it like?\n\n00:23:38:\n\n How did it fail?\n\n00:23:40:\n\n How can you improve it?\n\n00:23:41:\n\n What can we do to make this better?\n\n00:23:43:\n\n And how can I keep in touch with you so that when we do fix it, you'll be the first person to know, Like I feel like developer advocates are now.\n\n00:23:52:\n\n And this is someone who is not yet a developer advocate.\n\n00:23:55:\n\n This is something that's going to get into that space.\n\n00:23:57:\n\n Yeah, I feel like it is our role to almost be like developer slash sales person slash marketer slash customer service, like the that person that can figure out where I'm at on that path and then send them in the right direction.\n\n00:24:13:\n\n I think that's one of the things that you're able to do so well being able to be on social media, you are being ableto advocate for people who are, uh, just really genuinely smart.\n\n00:24:26:\n\n People now are trying to break into the industry, but then also being able to jump in and say this is a feeling this feeling is very legitimate.\n\n00:24:36:\n\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n00:24:37:\n\n We know Teoh not listen to us.\n\n00:24:40:\n\n We need to look Zack Pickett seriously, like Mongo.\n\n00:24:43:\n\n To be is like are like we're a little bit different.\n\n00:24:46:\n\n A lot of companies like our customers are developers.\n\n00:24:50:\n\n I think I've worked for companies where my customers are people purchasing a thing from our sites or using you know, to me it's like more traditional customers.\n\n00:24:58:\n\n But you have to listen And I think a lot since I see that I see this really big thing cos they're just like they don't listen.\n\n00:25:05:\n\n They're like, This is the way we're doing it.\n\n00:25:07:\n\n Get on board or or relieve about Yeah, you know, I mean, it feels more just like you were going Screw you.\n\n00:25:15:\n\n Come along if you want.\n\n00:25:16:\n\n You know, I mean, really, though even open source list stuff.\n\n00:25:18:\n\n But like they don't they're not reading your issues or submitting.\n\n00:25:22:\n\n They're not like reading suggestions.\n\n00:25:23:\n\n It's just like we're doing things we want to do.\n\n00:25:25:\n\n Deal.\n\n00:25:27:\n\n And that's a great idea, especially if you're like making a thing for a goal for community like, how can you do that in that?\n\n00:25:32:\n\n Listen to offers.\n\n00:25:34:\n\n And the other thing I want to touch on to is you talked about like how we should be listening and so in.\n\n00:25:39:\n\n Like, I used to see the old name developer evangelism, and I couldn't I don't like that name.\n\n00:25:44:\n\n Say, I imagine that like a preacher in front of ah, congregation preaching a products, it's trying to sell it without listening.\n\n00:25:51:\n\n You're just presenting definitely as a developer advocate.\n\n00:25:55:\n\n I'm advocating for you.\n\n00:25:56:\n\n The developer community internally as well is like So I'm like the middle person like I'm the face of the company to the customers, but also the voice of the customers, developers to like the internal product teams, tickets, Two Way street, you know, I mean evangelizing both ways.\n\n00:26:12:\n\n I think that's an important distinction from A I just I know I want to see you in, like this giant like Southern Baptist Church.\n\n00:26:20:\n\n Get the white robe on back from pop icon and I've come down from the mountain tops of of Pittsburgh.\n\n00:26:31:\n\n It seemed like a conference talks.\n\n00:26:32:\n\n I'm just like if I can't get any feedback from the the group on talking, it's like such an uncomfortable experience to me.\n\n00:26:39:\n\n I feel just and so we're just talking at people.\n\n00:26:42:\n\n I mean, there's a lot of these podcasts like it's like talk with someone.\n\n00:26:45:\n\n It's, I don't know.\n\n00:26:48:\n\n It's I feel like you don't feel like I'm just like, yeah, bring on a stage or something.\n\n00:26:51:\n\n I just feel like I don't know I don't know Any time I'm bored of someone, I think I'm just talking at a wall like this.\n\n00:26:56:\n\n Working that's actually the hard part about Like doing these online conferences is like usually like me on a Web cam, talking like 1000 people and maybe a couple people are chatting just like Is this landing?\n\n00:27:11:\n\n Is this work?\n\n00:27:12:\n\n It's hard, It's It's hard to tell.\n\n00:27:14:\n\n Have you been doing it for the talks where they have like okay, you have to record your talk first?\n\n00:27:20:\n\n Yes, and then sit there as your talk is being played in the chat so that you can jump back live and answer questions.\n\n00:27:28:\n\n Jay, it's the worst.\n\n00:27:30:\n\n I you see what I do, and you're like they want you to be in the chat like talking live with the group, which is awesome.\n\n00:27:36:\n\n I love that, but like hearing yourself talk while doing it.\n\n00:27:38:\n\n It's like the worst experience.\n\n00:27:41:\n\n I have been just muting myself because I can't I can't listen to myself at all.\n\n00:27:44:\n\n I can't I can't do it.\n\n00:27:46:\n\n It's so hard.\n\n00:27:48:\n\n Okay, cool.\n\n00:27:50:\n\n No one's thrown me out of the bus in the chat.\n\n00:27:53:\n\n That's good.\n\n00:27:54:\n\n And J I hit more nervous for a prerecorded talk than I do for just a lifetime.\n\n00:27:59:\n\n Yeah, I don't even know if I can explain why it's so hard for me.\n\n00:28:02:\n\n I mean, having having tried to do, like, some course type stuff, I can understand it because when you're giving a talk and this is coming from someone who's, ah, license but non practicing minister like, Oh, I have actually had to go in like preach.\n\n00:28:19:\n\n And I tend tohave this thing where I like black out for a certain amount of time.\n\n00:28:24:\n\n Yeah, And then I think at one point there was there was literally a sermon that I gave once where I told people like they didn't chill out.\n\n00:28:31:\n\n I was gonna just come out there and kick their ass.\n\n00:28:33:\n\n And it was like, This is not for me to aggressive.\n\n00:28:39:\n\n Yeah, that is like, I don't remember saying it, but it was just like it tonight.\n\n00:28:43:\n\n Traveling just takes over right?\n\n00:28:46:\n\n When I give a developer talk, it's like it's the same thing.\n\n00:28:49:\n\n It's like I can literally get up there.\n\n00:28:52:\n\n I've practiced.\n\n00:28:53:\n\n I've researched.\n\n00:28:54:\n\n I'm gonna black out spew whatever I have to say.\n\n00:28:56:\n\n Probably say something wrong.\n\n00:28:58:\n\n Try not to offend anyone and then jump down and be like, OK, cool.\n\n00:29:03:\n\n Now let me sit and talk with the people that just heard whatever it is, I said.\n\n00:29:07:\n\n And then when they tell me what they heard me say, I go, Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:29:12:\n\n That's exactly that's exactly what I was trying to get across.\n\n00:29:17:\n\n I love that.\n\n00:29:18:\n\n If you're recording a video, you're like it's just you and your thoughts and usually have your notes and you have it scripted.\n\n00:29:23:\n\n It's like right like I have Ah, no book here and I'm like, Well, yeah, that is instituted.\n\n00:29:29:\n\n It's like you can't It's so hard toe have that same type of I'm going to get up and do the thing that I get paid to do that.\n\n00:29:38:\n\n I'm confident about doing the energy that I know Aiken Dio when you shift it and put it all behind.\n\n00:29:45:\n\n Like, OK, we're gonna take this in 32 takes stitch together the best possible talk and then give you something to look at the end.\n\n00:29:54:\n\n I totally agree.\n\n00:29:55:\n\n It's it's hard like I am so mongo db We usually do like in person conference, and we have a lot of internal people who don't usually do talks they present.\n\n00:30:04:\n\n But we did it all online this year, obviously, because of cope it, Um, yeah, but it's hard.\n\n00:30:09:\n\n It was like it's a different feeling doing it unlined Teoh.\n\n00:30:13:\n\n I think the hardest part I've seen, too, is like you kind of don't you don't have that adrenaline.\n\n00:30:18:\n\n And I think if you're not ready for it, you kind of lose the energy.\n\n00:30:21:\n\n And I feel like, yeah, you know, it's like you're like right now.\n\n00:30:25:\n\n I'm just in my living room just talking at a wall with a webcam on it and like it could be easy go.\n\n00:30:31:\n\n It's like I don't have a crowd of people like hyping me up and cheering and clapping.\n\n00:30:35:\n\n It's like hard to keep the energy up.\n\n00:30:37:\n\n Uh, it's I don't be really intentional about it, Jay.\n\n00:30:41:\n\n I want to mention to in your talk with, like fighting someone during when you're talks.\n\n00:30:44:\n\n Like for me, what happens when I'm presenting?\n\n00:30:47:\n\n I lose all awareness of my body.\n\n00:30:50:\n\n It's, uh, it's just so weird.\n\n00:30:54:\n\n I don't It's like I'm focusing too much on like what I'm saying and how to say it.\n\n00:30:58:\n\n Then, like my body's like flailing around, waving the hands around, knocking things over and like hitting the microphone, its eyes were like a speech coach That's been like helping, like, retuned my my presence up and like, they're like, You gotta work on you gotta work on your body.\n\n00:31:16:\n\n It's like Is you looking like you look like a crazy person up there?\n\n00:31:20:\n\n Can't I'm so bad at it.\n\n00:31:23:\n\n The adrenal and I can't help.\n\n00:31:24:\n\n But I don't know, one of the talks I gave in Ah, North Bay, and this is probably the last thing before we jump into the after show one of the talks about North Bay.\n\n00:31:33:\n\n We, um it was the first talk I'd ever give, like first developer talk I had given.\n\n00:31:38:\n\n So and it was about podcasting.\n\n00:31:41:\n\n Yeah, developer conference.\n\n00:31:43:\n\n We're gonna talk about podcasts, and the interesting thing was I was so nervous and there was like, Oh, you'll do finally feel like you can do this.\n\n00:31:53:\n\n You got it.\n\n00:31:53:\n\n You get on podcast every week and talking stuff.\n\n00:31:56:\n\n It's just like a podcast.\n\n00:31:57:\n\n So I literally treated it like a podcast, like, you remember the whole, like, run through that I ran like that.\n\n00:32:03:\n\n I we did before we started is a What's your name to pronounce that enough.\n\n00:32:06:\n\n I literally went through that script, like, for myself.\n\n00:32:12:\n\n So I have My name is J.\n\n00:32:13:\n\n Miller.\n\n00:32:13:\n\n My pronouns air, he and him.\n\n00:32:14:\n\n I'm, uh we're gonna talk about this and then just jump into it, like, all right, I'm gonna get myself some time, drink some water, don't at the end.\n\n00:32:23:\n\n Like I was actually using the podium that they had out there to make sure that I wasn't like bouncing all over the place.\n\n00:32:30:\n\n It was just like I had her had a remote control.\n\n00:32:33:\n\n I was like, Hey, if a part of my body can't touch the podium, I've gone too far.\n\n00:32:37:\n\n I needed exactly baguette.\n\n00:32:40:\n\n You like tethers that podia I need, like, chain myself to it.\n\n00:32:43:\n\n Otherwise I am just Yeah, that's smart.\n\n00:32:46:\n\n That's more.\n\n00:32:46:\n\n You gotta like that.\n\n00:32:47:\n\n But some people like that, though, because I mean even afterwards, like I talked, Teoh, a developer advocate for Microsoft, was talking right after me, and he was like, Great job.\n\n00:32:57:\n\n You should have given that talk from the middle of the stage and not from the podium like that.\n\n00:33:02:\n\n He's like, That's the Onley.\n\n00:33:04:\n\n Like a point that I had is that you felt like you were tethered to that podium like I was.\n\n00:33:08:\n\n He was like, But no, you weren't.\n\n00:33:09:\n\n You had a lapel mic on you had a remote control like you literally caught your from anywhere.\n\n00:33:14:\n\n Why did you just keep yourself isolated?\n\n00:33:16:\n\n That one And I was like, Well, doing it.\n\n00:33:18:\n\n I guess it's not like Twitter.\n\n00:33:19:\n\n Like a podcast.\n\n00:33:20:\n\n I can totally the ability to move around.\n\n00:33:23:\n\n Yeah, I totally get that, too.\n\n00:33:25:\n\n Then that been smart.\n\n00:33:26:\n\n I know you think about like what you want to focus on or like trying hides its.\n\n00:33:30:\n\n I totally get that.\n\n00:33:32:\n\n I'm so bad that it's and I totally brew that my perception advocate a body body presence and like where you are so important, it's hard.\n\n00:33:41:\n\n It's hard to deal and like like twitching like podcasting.\n\n00:33:44:\n\n You're trying, like, manage a key point in time.\n\n00:33:46:\n\n I twitch trying like you track the track moderate that I'm trying like live code and salt record faltering problems live like deep like it.\n\n00:33:54:\n\n It's just like a lot.\n\n00:33:56:\n\n The things to balance mentally and our puny human brains can like.\n\n00:34:00:\n\n Our is terrible at multitasking.\n\n00:34:02:\n\n That's why you play video games on switch.\n\n00:34:05:\n\n Better.\n\n00:34:06:\n\n Better Doing actual work is hard, like it's all hard.\n\n00:34:11:\n\n J.\n\n00:34:12:\n\n It's so hard to do real work on their, uh, I've been doing life.\n\n00:34:15:\n\n Couldn't probably get your Now on there.\n\n00:34:16:\n\n It's It's it can hurt.\n\n00:34:18:\n\n It is nice.\n\n00:34:19:\n\n So if I get like a bug and some of the chat like notes of a software bug, which is nice, but that is it's pretty rare sleeping like, Wow, this guy doesn't just staring at me exactly.\n\n00:34:32:\n\n I'm sweating and floundering, trying to solve these problems live but to that point to idle like that's what like what's which, though it's like

the last 5 months[^1], I've applied for many Software Engineering and Developer Advocate Roles.\n\nI'm happy to announce, starting next month, I will be working with [Elastic](https://elastic.co) as a Developer Advocate.\n\n![elastic logo](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/brand-elastic-sop-lockup-220x130.svg)\n\n## What About PIT?\n\nProductivity in Tech means so much to me. I've been reassured that the work that I do with PIT can continue.\n\nThat said, I have made the decision will not be accepting new clients while I transition into this new role.\n\n## What About Your Projects?\n\nYou can expect a _small_ reduction in _new feature work_[^2] while I'm adjusting to the new role. All the projects that I have been working on are Open-Source (MIT Licensed). everyone is welcome to make open source contributions to them.\n\n## What About Content?\n\nThe blog content will continue at it's _irregularly-scheduled_ pace.\n\nThe PIT Podcast has enough episodes lined up for the rest of the year [^3]\nThere is no current plan to stop doing the PIT Podcast with the alternating format.\n\nElastic is aware of the other projects I co-host and has no intention in asking me to stop any of them.\n\nMy livestreams are currently going to continue on a 4-5 times a week pace. This could reduce if I start streaming on behalf of my employer. There are no official plans at the moment.\n\n## So Why Elastic\n\nSo I hope that I have shown you a little of the attitude and enviroment that Elastic presented to me. There were many amazing things about the company that made me happy to be considered for the role. But there was one thing they did very well.\n\n**They have a successful history of hiring outside of tech.**\n\nThis opportunity came to me because of [some wonderful people in the industry](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller/status/1292930503125823488?s=20). I had amazing folks on my side, and I want to make sure that I can point folks to potential opportunities as as well. I want to work with companies that see folks from outside of traditional tech as valuable as _classically_ trained individuals.\n\nDuring the interview process, I had the pleasure to talk with several people at Elastic who, before working with the company, considered themselves _non-techical_. These were people in leadership roles. This showed me people have an opportunity to grow inside the company even if they lack the history that tends to be a gate preventing people from moving up in their career.\n\n## When can you See Me \"At Work\"?\n\nAround the same time I accepted the position, I selected to speak at the [PyGotham Virtual Online Conference](https://pygotham.tv) to speak about [Transcriptor](https://github.com/kjaymiller/transcriptor). I will showcase how I using the Elastic Stack to make transcriptions easier for developers!\n\nThere is nothing to report on live-streaming, blogging, podcasting, or speaking on behalf of Elastic. There have been some conversations and there will be some opportunities. I am happy to bring my skills to the team in whatever ways they feel would make the best impact!\n\nI look forward to the future with Elastic!\n\n\n[^1]: I've been searching a total of 5 years but this most resent bout in the application ring started around April of 2020.\n[^2]: If you've followed me on social and on this site, this was coming anyway as I'm starting to develop more testing and documentation around my projects.\n[^3]: Of course we will wrap up the season when we break for the holidays.", "title": "My New Job and What that Means for All the Things I Do", "date": "2020-08-17T16:41:00-07:00", "tags": "['job']", "category": "Life", "image": "https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/brand-elastic-sop-lockup-220x130.svg", "slug": "my-new-job-and-what-that-means-for-all-the-things-i-do", "url": "/my-new-job-and-what-that-means-for-all-the-things-i-do", "date_published": "Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:41:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Aug 17, 2020 16:41 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"base_content": "What are people yelling about?\n\nI scrolled through a twitter thread about asking people to give a side by side comparison of candidate x and candidate y in regarding how their policy affected underrepresented groups. \n\nThe responses were:\n\n- people praising the OP for their bravery\n- people shouting \"What about candidate z?\"\n- people talking about what candidate x/y did NOT do\n- People posting out of context quotes and pictures furthering their own agenda\n\nThe fear I have is, for all I know someone was genuinely hoping to learn, and instead was shouted at.

I wonder if the perks (sense of community, networking opportunities, learning from amazing folks) are worth dealing with the things I don't care about. I want to hear about so many things. \n\n- Great new podcasts from people struggling with their Productivity\n- Podcasts of people that are so in love with a topic that they will wax poetic to an audience of 4 on a regular basis\n- Cats doing amazing tricks\n- Videos of people failing so hard\n- Great Tutorials on Minecraft Redstone Techniques\n- Comprehensive Guides on How to Make Amazing Coffee when you don't have a thermometer, gooseneck kettle\n- People motivation folks around them that are crying out for help\n- People crying out for help!\n- People that are openly doubt their knowledge but are still putting themselves out there because they hope people will support them.\n- People building things to learn and are wanting feedback\n- People Passionate about building automation tools to solve their unique and quirky problems\n\nThe guys at [Internet Friends](https://internetfriends.show) proposed a wonderful way that twitter would be more appealing.\n\n\"I want a social media service that lets people post all they want and the ALGORITHM gives you the best 100 posts that day.\"\n\nTo expand on that, I would love it so that you can only see the replies. If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.\n\nI've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.\n\n- I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). \n- I'm tired of being told to yell at people. \n \nI'm just SO TIRED. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nDear Social Media Companies:\n\tI don't care about followers anymore.\n\n\tDon't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. \n\n\tI know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line. \n\n\tDon't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?\n\nAnother tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. \n\nI'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.\n\n\nI'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.\n\nThe perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. \n\n...

Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.\n\nI don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and\nbecome equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.\nInstead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust\npunishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never\nable to gain any amount of legitimate growth.\n\nForce the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that\nare disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest\nperson of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the\nonly one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.\n\nIf you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely\n(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for\nyou.\n\n## On Rioting\n\nIn my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.\nFurthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me\nfrom my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked\nto be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and\nthe fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint\nand had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took\nthem from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the\nage of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop\ncar over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.\n\nMeanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,\nuneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you\nhave pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local\ncommunities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation\nof Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict\ngovernment oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.\n\nIt took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is\nfounded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we\nmurdered until we got it.\n\nWe did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to\nourselves (see civil war).\n\nNow when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our\nnation call us Terrorists.\n\nWhile I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and\nmaintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying\nthe example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those\nthat murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while\nthe rest of society looked away.\n\n## On The Legal System\n\nIn regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who\nhave the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout\nmy wishes:\n\n* A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down\n* More racial and gender diversity in police forces\n* Mandatory implicit bias checks and training\n* Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making\n  an arrest.\n* The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws\n\nThese ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how\nthey can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that\ncan't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up\nfor themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly.

While I was certain that I could figure it out, _Transcriptor_ was designed for custom text templates, not the standard SRT format. So instead of doing manual conversion of these files I decided to put the work in to make _Transcriptor_ support both the importing and exporting of SRT files. This meant also for the first time working with the end_times in text markers and focusing on getting timing down to the exact word. \n\nWhile there were wonderful options to work with SRT files I knew that I would want to build my own variation of an SRT engine. This was mostly because of future plans for transcriptor which for the first time I'm putting out there. \n\n\nYou can create a `Job` object from an srt using `Job.from_srt()`. and passing in the filepath of the object.\n\n```python\nfrom transcriptor import Job\n\nNewSRTJob = Job.from_srt('./srt_file.srt')\n```\n\nThis give you the ability to create new objects from this job (currently a text transcription file). You also have the ability to break down the transcription word by word and by marker. This gives you the ability to apply shifts to all or some of the srt files without having to re-index the project.\n\n```python\nfor marker in NewSRTJob.markers:\n\tmarker.start_time += 2.0\n\tmarker.end_time -= 2.0\n\nPath('shifted_srt_file.srt').write_text(NewSRTJob.srt)\n```\n\nSRT support is avaiable on versions of _Transcriptor_ since the version series of 2020.07.
