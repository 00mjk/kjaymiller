Black communities are considered dangerous because of generalizations and scare tactics. Not every black neighborhood is the same depiction of South Central LA and most neighborhoods are so gentrified that black people can't afford to live in their communities anymore.\n2. There are extreme wage and education disparities between black and white families. Something to the tune of about $150,000.\n3. We can't blame \"fathers not being in the homes\". Black fathers are more likely to attend family functions and are likely to stay married longer than their white counterparts.\n4. White Americans don't know this, because the only glimpse of Black America is what they see on TV in the news or what they've been told for generations.\n\nThat's it.\n\nMy thought is if you can fix number 2. Then you can improve the these \"Dangerous\" communities and ultimately destroy the PR stunt that has been hurting black folks for the last couple hundred years\n\n### How Do You Fix Number 2?\n\nMake education accessible (cheaper) or you make it less important.\n\nAs someone with over a decade of experience in the tech space. I was able to do that because someone gave me a chance and I proved them right.\n\nMy chance came from my experience in the Armed Forces. That is not something that all people of color will have.\n\nI will put it clearly...\n\n**HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PAY ALL PEOPLE BASED ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE, NOT EDUCATION.**\n\nIt won't solve the problems tomorrow (That's for legislation and representation in our government to do.) But it will do something to reduce the wage gap in America. It will make our communities better and more affluent (and reduce crime).\n\n> \"_We can't pull ourselves up by our bootstraps if we can't afford boots._\" - Someone that at one point couldn't afford boots.", "title": "How Can White People Help Black People.

Some places still believe in structural genocide. We are not saying that we are the only ones. We are just saying that for too long we've been told one thing which is not true. That we are considered equal by those in power.\n\nI don't think that people can be systemically hindered for generations and\nbecome equal in about 75 years without radical assistance from those in power.\nInstead, through the aggressive policing, racist legislature, and unjust\npunishment those that have can keep theirs and those without are never\nable to gain any amount of legitimate growth.\n\nForce the sharing of wealth, give more opportunity to those that\nare disadvantaged. If you are already doing this, good, do more. The richest\nperson of color in America is about 148 on the list of top 200 and he's the\nonly one. Black people don't even have a seat at the table.\n\nIf you complain that they didn't do anything to earn their wealth, most likely\n(considering wealth is usually generational), I would argue the same goes for\nyou.\n\n## On Rioting\n\nIn my lifetime I have been caught stealing. Simply put a white male some years my senior, broke into my house and my truck and stole from me.\nFurthermore, my landlord, amid nasty divorce chose to evict me\nfrom my apartment due to water damage from HIS FAULTY AC UNIT that I had asked\nto be repaired. He cited my broken stove (which was broken when I moved in) and\nthe fact that I had (with his permission) painted the walls with chalk paint\nand had decorated it with friends as the reason. I decided to get my things back but instead of from them, I took\nthem from the Walton Family (WALMART). I was arrested for shoplifting at the\nage of 17 for stealing a pair of gloves and some chapstick. I was put in a cop\ncar over a pair of gloves and some chapstick.\n\nMeanwhile in Africa, where Western Education would tell you they are underdeveloped,\nuneducated and rely on our benevolence to survive which is simply untrue, you\nhave pioneers and innovators that are making a difference in their local\ncommunities and in the world, many of these are women-led, like the Nation\nof Rwanda who has shortened the gender wage and job gap through strict\ngovernment oversight after the crisis left many of their young men dead.\n\nIt took massive amounts of violence to finally spark change. Our country is\nfounded on this notion. We did not get what we want so we stole, and we\nmurdered until we got it.\n\nWe did this to the first peoples, we did it to the British, we did it to\nourselves (see civil war).\n\nNow when we do it and we are labeled terrorists and have the leaders of our\nnation call us Terrorists.\n\nWhile I choose not to destroy the things that some have worked to build and\nmaintain. I do not blame those that choose to. They are merely copying\nthe example that has been set before them but the founders of our nation and those\nthat murdered and looted us for years in white hoods and police badges while\nthe rest of society looked away.\n\n## On The Legal System\n\nIn regards to a racist system, it will be hard to say anything that people who\nhave the potential to make a difference will respond to. So I'll just layout\nmy wishes:\n\n* A federal mandate towards more stringent investigations when unarmed suspects are gunned down\n* More racial and gender diversity in police forces\n* Mandatory implicit bias checks and training\n* Harsher penalties for body cams not being properly charged or on when making\n  an arrest.\n* The elimination of the stand your ground and citizens arrest laws\n\nThese ideas are mostly from conversations with folks that have asked me how\nthey can best help. If you want to help, be an advocate and ally for those that\ncan't advocate for themselves. Stand up for those that can't afford to stand up\nfor themselves. Punish those that punish unjustly.

I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.\n\nFor many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.\n\nFor me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do. \n\nI joined the Marine Corps.\n\n### But Why\n\n> For what is a man, what has he got?\n\n> If not himself, then he has naught\n\n> To say the things he truly feels\n\n> And not the words of one who kneels\n\n> The record shows, I took the blows\n\n> And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra\n\nI have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me. \n\nIn my opinion, being told, \"I can't\" is the biggest motivator.\n\nWhen I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).\n\nIn my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.\n\n### I do a lot.\n\n* I work a Day job.\n* I manage a [side business](https://productivityintech.com) helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.\n* I [write code](https://github.com/kjaymiller).\n* I host a range of [podcasts](/projects) from tech to gaming.\n* I'm a member of an Esports organization and [stream regularly](https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller).\n\nMy _coding_ skills help me **automate** and **optimize** my day job.\n\nMy _day job_ skills, challenge me to **think differently** and **shake up stale thought**.\n\nMy _podcasting_ and _streaming_ skills gave me the ability to identify ways that **I could help my\nside-business clients** in **their** content-creating journey.\n\nThey may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that\nqualifies me to do what I do, how I do it. \n\nI know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots. \n\nDonald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.\n\nJanelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos.

Miller here back with a so low pit reflection type thing for the first half of June 2020. this year has sucked royally.\n\n00:00:32:\n\nI don't even want to get into this. Um, all of the individual things that have happened in 2020 have just been nightmares had best.\n\n00:00:46:\n\nSo this is going to be more of a productivity's side thought exercise for me, and I hope that it will engage your mind a little bit as we sit down and talk.\n\nThat said, it is gonna be a little bit off the head. I have some notes and I'll use those notes. But ultimately, I'm just using them to riff off of.\n\n00:01:13:\n\nSo let's start with a couple of things. First of all, productivity's in general. What am I doing, Productivity wise?\n\nUm, if you would have asked me this question yesterday, I would have told you something different. I am jumping back to the notebook. I go to the notebook like probably once a year. I'm gonna try to do a full year.\n\n00:01:38:\n\nDon't at me. Don't challenge me. Don't do any of those things the way that I see it productivity tools, productivity, apps, productivity. All of those things should be used for you to do your best work. None of these tools should be considered a Bible or any type of gospel for you to breach or proselytize on others.\n\n00:02:06:\n\nIn fact, I'm not using this podcast to preach or proselytize my own productivity method. I am merely telling people how I am doing a thing in hopes that if someone else that is doing something similar here, is it that I might be able to inspire them to try something that works for them or for them to reach out to me and let me know of something that did work for them without any obligation to join the Church of Notion or Rome research or obsidian or all these other apps that said, Let's jump into this.\n\n00:02:51:\n\nWhat absolute using. Like I said, up until today, when I said, You know what, we need to get back on our analog light, our BuJo-esque system.\n\n00:03:03:\n\nI would have said I was using OmniFocus. Um, I think for right now I I don't really have too much stuff in OmniFocus. That will make it hard to transition.\n\n00:03:19:\n\nI wasn't really using OmniFocus as the power tool that most people use it as, um, it was simply a way for me to differ things so that I didn't have to look at him.\n\nGood thing is a notebook and a piece of paper kind of does the same thing. I just don't need to look at it now.\n\n00:03:39:\n\nOne of the biggest apps that I have jumped on. Probably the biggest change in my workflow since leaving Evernote back in 2000 and what, 10? Yeah, I think 2010 was when I left Evernote or not.\n\n00:03:57:\n\nDidn't leave it like the company I stopped using.\n\n00:03:59:\n\nThe application is the adoption of DevonThink now, DevonThink, is one of these tools that I think that a lot of people are intimidated by one.\n\n00:04:13:\n\nIt's an expensive tool.\n\n00:04:15:\n\nI get that. Yeah, it's expensive.\n\n00:04:17:\n\nOh, boy, A suspensive.\n\nIt's like fountain pen money expensive.\n\n00:04:23:\n\nThe thing I like about Devonhink is I don't have to question where I put a thing.\n\n00:04:31:\n\nI deal with a lot of files between the day job, the side business and the other ambitions and inspirations that I have.\n\n00:04:42:\n\nSo for me, it is important that when I'm looking for a thing, I can find it with relative ease.\n\n00:04:51:\n\nDevonThink allows me to do that.\n\n00:04:54:\n\nIt does its job really well.\n\n00:04:58:\n\nAnd the thing that makes it different from, you know, another power tool that I use Drafts or Evernote or again, like a Notion or Rome Research kind of tool is that one.\n\n00:05:15:\n\nIt beats all the cloud tools because it's designed to work with my local machine.\n\n00:05:21:\n\nSo adding some order to my chaotic system.\n\n00:05:26:\n\nThe other thing that it does is it make some connections and allows me to easily connect things that should be connected.\n\n00:05:39:\n\nAnd it allows me to look at different things from many different schools of thought, which isn't always the best way to do things.\n\n00:05:54:\n\nBut when you need to, it is amazing.\n\n00:06:01:\n\nSo again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this.\n\n00:06:03:\n\nIf you've been looking at DevonThink you'd know all the stuff that I could talk about with it?\n\n00:06:09:\n\nUm, if you aren't looking into DevonThink unless you just genuinely have a problem with maintaining lots and lots of files and documents and things like that over a long period of time.\n\n00:06:22:\n\nOr you're just fed up with Evernote as a whole and its inability to, um, not move like a giant green elephant in a china shop, you know, then I mean, give it a try.\n\n00:06:37:\n\nThere's a free trial.\n\n00:06:38:\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n00:06:39:\n\nI mean, if you really want to talk about it, they have a forum.\n\n00:06:42:\n\nThey have, um a lot of people that air again, much more avid users shout out to the Nested Folders podcast.\n\n00:06:50:\n\nThey did a great to show seriess on how they both use. DevonThink in their own systems.\n\n00:06:59:\n\nOne, uh, uses it more of, ah, file cabinet, the other one more of ah ah, thought companion.\n\n00:07:10:\n\nBut there's an app that I wanted to talk about a little bit from the business side, and this is after I haven't used a hun.\n\n00:07:23:\n\nBut I've used it.\n\n00:07:25:\n\nAnd when I have used it, it has had a really good effect.\n\n00:07:30:\n\nUh, I used to do business meetings any type of any time I was doing, like a client consultation.\n\n00:07:36:\n\nI would use something like notion.\n\n00:07:39:\n\nUm, I'm a firm believer in the idea of shared notes are better when you're able to collaborate on them.\n\n00:07:50:\n\nThe one problem that I had with notion initially was that you know, you get us up in account, you got to give them access, they can watch, you do stuff, and that's cool.\n\n00:07:59:\n\nBut ultimately, it doesn't feel as inviting for someone that's not a part of your team to come in and start working with you.\n\n00:08:07:\n\nAnd there was also, like the pricing question and things like that.\n\n00:08:10:\n\nBut for the last couple of consultations that I've had, I have used a tool called Miro. MIRO is an interesting little tool.\n\n00:08:22:\n\nIt is basically a collaborative white board, and it's designed to be a collaborative white board. One of the things I like about is that it also gives you a section for your notes. It allows you to attach things. It allows you to collect a bunch of stuff under one umbrella.\n\n00:08:38:\n\nI mean, imagine having a giant whiteboard and being able to just have everybody writing on it and asking questions and commenting and doing things like that.\n\n00:08:49:\n\nI really like it, Um, especially for like a consultation type thing.\n\n00:08:57:\n\nI haven't used it at the premium level where they have stuff like of voice and video chat and stuff like that.\n\n00:09:06:\n\nI mean, just you zoom.\n\n00:09:08:\n\nOr I think in my last consultation call, I like, I think we just use facetime and then, ah, you know, as we were talking, you know, we're both at and stuff into it so that I mean, that's cool by itself.\n\n00:09:21:\n\nBut yeah, I mean, again, just this isn't an attempt to get people to try stuff.\n\n00:09:27:\n\nIt's more of Ah, hey, here's something that if you haven't heard about it and it's something that it suits you, then sure, why not take a crack at it?\n\n00:09:34:\n\nIt's not gonna be life changing for someone unless it is the exact thing that they're looking for.\n\n00:09:42:\n\nSo we've talked a little bit about the productivity side of things.\n\n00:09:47:\n\nLet's jump into the projects.\n\n00:09:51:\n\nAh, but to do nothings really changed much on the project side of life.\n\n00:09:55:\n\nI mean, it is it's still basically render engine and transcript.\n\n00:09:59:\n\nOr for me, I do believe the last time we had a conversation like this transcript her waas still just a jangle app now it is no longer jingle app.\n\n00:10:09:\n\nIt is a python package.\n\n00:10:13:\n\nYes, but he s the best way to put it.\n\n00:10:16:\n\nAt the end of the day, I realized that I don't want to build a SAS AB.\n\n00:10:21:\n\nI know that there are a bunch of people out there.\n\n00:10:23:\n\nThey're like, Oh, yeah, SAS applications.\n\n00:10:25:\n\nThat's passive income and smart revenue.\n\n00:10:28:\n\nAnd there's a whole conversation to have about that.\n\n00:10:31:\n\nBut that is not me.\n\n00:10:33:\n\nWhat I enjoy doing more than anything is helping people directly by me providing a service to them.\n\n00:10:41:\n\nNow I know that's not scalable.\n\n00:10:43:\n\nI understand that.\n\n00:10:45:\n\nI don't care.\n\n00:10:46:\n\nUm, there's a excellent book that I've been reading on and off, you know, for the last who knows how long.\n\n00:10:52:\n\nCalled Company of One by Paul Jarvis.\n\n00:10:55:\n\nI think that there is an amazing idea at an amazing benefit to imposing a limit of scalability on yourself and on your company.\n\n00:11:09:\n\nAnd here's Here's what I mean, if I use pit transcript er, as you know, we'll pick transcript of the Django app.\n\n00:11:17:\n\nIt's It's a great tool that allows anybody to sign up for an account and start doing transcriptions and Ultimately, I'm eating the cost, which means I'm having to charge people memberships, which means I am now in the business of customer service.\n\n00:11:31:\n\nI'm in the business of tech support, and I am in the business of having to explain to people why Amazon transcribe does some of the things that it does because of how it does it.\n\n00:11:44:\n\nAnd there are a lot of different things that Amazon transcribe Google Cloud Platform or Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\n00:11:54:\n\nAll of these services do certain things because they have to in order to scale at the level that they want to scale.\n\n00:12:03:\n\nBut what's the alternative here?\n\n00:12:07:\n\nI could build a system that allows me personally to do transcriptions at a rate that I can afford in that I could maintain and by providing it as a python package.\n\n00:12:22:\n\nThere is a level of support that I'm willing to give, but a lot of that is I can now define the scope of the application of the package that I'm supporting.\n\n00:12:37:\n\nIf I decide that the transcript or packages on Lee going to support a ws transcribe, then okay, I have the ability to do that if I decide that transcript er is not going to support custom vocabulary.\n\n00:13:03:\n\nI can do that if I and these are all things that I have chosen to do.\n\n00:13:13:\n\nIf I decide that transcript is only going to focus on the resulted output of a transcription job and not the actual processing of the job itself, I conduce that.\n\n00:13:29:\n\nAnd by doing that, I narrow the scope that I am responsible for to my clients.\n\n00:13:38:\n\nI'm Onley responsible for the actual job that they're paying me to do.\n\n00:13:47:\n\nThey're not paying me to maintain a python packages or maintaining Meteo or they're paying me too.\n\n00:13:52:\n\nProvide them with a transcription.\n\n00:13:57:\n\nAnd the developers that are using the tool that I have built are I mean, they're not paying me at all, but they're relying on me, too.\n\n00:14:10:\n\nProvide a level of knowledge and service about the platform, or about the system that I have created all while while having the ability to take it and make it their own because it is an open source.\n\n00:14:25:\n\nA pack same thing with render engine render engine by default as a static side generator is designed to be very flexible, but because I'm not selling static sites is a service.\n\n00:14:45:\n\nI'm Onley providing a system for generating sites.\n\n00:14:52:\n\nThat is a level of insight that I don't have to provide.\n\n00:14:56:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper s CEO.\n\n00:14:59:\n\nI don't have to teach people proper CD in usage and compression of images and things like that.\n\n00:15:05:\n\nMy system does not care about these things.\n\n00:15:09:\n\nIt does not benefit them anyway.\n\n00:15:11:\n\nThe only way that we were able to integrate sire like a search capability, like for those who don't know, one of the big achievements of he had this year for render engine is the integration in with a fuse dot Js, which is a static site search.\n\n00:15:30:\n\nUm, that's all done on the client side.\n\n00:15:34:\n\nBasically, you supply a JavaScript package with a Jason Output and you can search that file poor content.\n\n00:15:46:\n\nNow they're probably better ways to do it.\n\n00:15:50:\n\nI'm sure you could offload that to another service, but my assumption is if you're building static sites, you have a certain thought about offloading stuff to third party service.\n\n00:16:07:\n\nUm, but, you know, part of my thought pattern was Do I want to support looter?\n\n00:16:14:\n\nAnother static site search engine do I want to support, um, elastic search and do I want to support?\n\n00:16:23:\n\nYou know, Al Gore, Uh, or out was What is it?\n\n00:16:28:\n\nYeah, Al Gore as either Al Gore or Al Gloria.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nSomething like that.\n\n00:16:31:\n\nI think it's Al Gore.\n\n00:16:33:\n\nAnd because I wasn't saying, Hey, everybody, here's a platform that, you know, you give me $10 a month and I host your static site.\n\n00:16:45:\n\nYou know, feed.\n\n00:16:45:\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with people that are doing that.\n\n00:16:47:\n\nYou know, shout out to the whole micro dot blawg service and man Reese and Gene McDonald and the other people that are a part of making that a reality.\n\n00:16:56:\n\nUm, that's just not me.\n\n00:16:58:\n\nThat's just not what I'm aiming to do.\n\n00:17:01:\n\nI would much rather make sure stuff that I'm doing is compatible with what they're doing.\n\n00:17:06:\n\nAnd they have really made that easy.\n\n00:17:07:\n\nSo again, big shout out to them.\n\n00:17:12:\n\nSo I guess in this rambling that is kind of my big take away in this whole conversation is there's something to say about the idea of controlling the scope of your projects, and that is something that I am learning more and more of as I get older and as I want to do more things while having more responsibilities is, I have to be able to control the scope of what I'm doing.\n\n00:17:50:\n\nSo the big pit question for you that I want to hear about, whether it's on Twitter or whether you want to email me at info it productivity in tech dot com is how are you controlling the scope of the things that you're doing?\n\n00:18:13:\n\nAnd furthermore, what can you do in order to begin controlling the scope of some things that might have gotten out of control?\n\n00:18:30:\n\nI'm gonna leave it there because the last, you know, five minutes or so of this little podcast thing, it's going to be devoted to a little bit of, ah administration work here.\n\n00:18:45:\n\nSo I've been thinking more and more about Pitt as a community, as a group of people Maurin Mawr during this time with racial injustice and things like that happening.\n\n00:19:04:\n\nHave I not been more proud of the black community that I've been a part of, you know, obviously from birth, but also the vocal community and the amount of ally ship that I have around me and that has made me want to value the people within that community.\n\n00:19:29:\n\nMore and more now, I'm still not sure how that involves pit, but what I have learned is that I want to be able to support of the things and the people that are doing amazing things more and more.\n\n00:19:50:\n\nAnd by doing that, I have to have the support of the community.\n\n00:19:55:\n\nSo here is my I thought I would be willing toe have more conversations like this on a regular basis if there were some form of feedback one, there has to be feedback on it.\n\n00:20:23:\n\nI don't I don't mind shouting into the either, but the actual time it takes tow, edit and record this.\n\n00:20:29:\n\nAnd I mean, even the editing isn't much, but I cough a lot.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm an asthmatic.\n\n00:20:32:\n\nI'm a chronic asthmatic.\n\n00:20:34:\n\nThere's a lot of coughing that's involved in a lot of people.\n\n00:20:36:\n\nSometimes here and then sometimes don't hear, depending on my mood.\n\n00:20:43:\n\nOne.\n\n00:20:44:\n\nThere's got to be feedback in the term and in actual like conversation.\n\n00:20:51:\n\nI'm only sharing this stuff with you because I want to start a conversation.\n\n00:20:58:\n\nIf there's no desire for a conversation to be had then I have no reason to continues speaking about it.\n\n00:21:10:\n\nThe other side is it has to make sense from a time value perspective.\n\n00:21:18:\n\nAs some may noticed, I have upped the transparency of me searching for, um, I want to say a job, but searching for a way to provide for my family?\n\n00:21:33:\n\nNo, I have a job.\n\n00:21:36:\n\nI'm not worried about getting fired today, at least, and pit is still growing.\n\n00:21:43:\n\nI mean, last year was the best year for pit, which I mean.\n\n00:21:47:\n\nLuckily, the company's only two years old, so you know, hopefully, hopefully we can continue moving in a positive direction.\n\n00:21:58:\n\nBut the time that it takes to record this I'm currently sitting at 22 minutes, 39 seconds.\n\n00:22:05:\n\nI think on the actual recording, it's like 22 minutes, five seconds, something like that.\n\n00:22:10:\n\nBut I was working on a transcription before I started doing this, and I said, You know what?\n\n00:22:16:\n\nI really need to get that thing done.\n\n00:22:17:\n\nSo if I'm going to do more things like that, I need to make sure that I'm not taking away time from my family without it making sense from a from a value perspective.\n\n00:22:37:\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\n00:22:41:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be a patri on?\n\n00:22:42:\n\nNo.\n\n00:22:43:\n\nDoes that mean there's gonna be ah member full or something like that?\n\n00:22:47:\n\nNo, I don't know what it means at the moment.\n\n00:22:51:\n\nWhat I'm looking for is one person.\n\n00:22:56:\n\nI'm looking for a couple things.\n\n00:22:57:\n\nI'm looking for two people to listen to this and tell me that they heard it.\n\n00:23:02:\n\nThey enjoyed it or they heard it and they didn't enjoy it.\n\n00:23:05:\n\nAnd here's why.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nOr they heard it.\n\n00:23:06:\n\nAnd I'm an idiot or whatever.\n\n00:23:09:\n\nThe other thing I want to hear is someone say I have heard this.\n\n00:23:13:\n\nI appreciate it.\n\n00:23:15:\n\nIt brought me value.\n\n00:23:17:\n\nAnd I want to, in some way, shape or form compensate you for the value that you've put out.\n\n00:23:27:\n\nNow, if you feel like you can't afford that, by all means, I understand I'm not even saying that you have to feel obligated to give me money.\n\n00:23:39:\n\nI am saying that if this truly brings value to you and you feel like you would be willing to do something to ensure that this value continued to happen, I need to know, because otherwise all I'm doing is wasting my time and my energy putting something out there that no one's listening to now, the pit podcast as a whole.\n\n00:24:07:\n\nThe interviews they will still happen because I enjoy.\n\n00:24:09:\n\nI enjoy the conversations.\n\n00:24:12:\n\nAt the present time, I have five six interviews scheduled in like the next month.\n\n00:24:24:\n\nI can stretch those out for the remainder of the year, and that will be the entire pit season.\n\n00:24:30:\n\nOr I can release them on a bi weekly, maybe even weekly basis, like we used to back in the good old days.\n\n00:24:40:\n\nBut I'm not going to do that at the stake of my sanity, knowing that it's not going to make an impact in anyone's life or knowing that the people who are consuming it are just using.\n\n00:24:54:\n\nIt is background noise.\n\n00:24:55:\n\nI cannot do that.\n\n00:24:57:\n\nSo here's the promise that I'm making today as I'm recording this and this will be released is June 10th.\n\n00:25:05:\n\nIf by June 20th we have one pledge to somehow pay for this service, you know, pay for this podcast, not even not even monetarily.\n\n00:25:21:\n\nMaybe it's just in terms of like, Hey, I promise that if you put in episode, I will retweet it and I will reply with a comment.\n\n00:25:30:\n\nI am okay with that being the currency.\n\n00:25:33:\n\nI love your money.\n\n00:25:34:\n\nBut if you don't have it, I understand.\n\n00:25:37:\n\nSome of us just don't have it.\n\n00:25:40:\n\nAnd if I have two people that can just say Hey, you know what?\n\n00:25:44:\n\nI really enjoyed the conversation.\n\n00:25:45:\n\nI really enjoyed the thought piece.\n\n00:25:47:\n\nThis is what I did like.\n\n00:25:48:\n\nThis is what I didn't

\n\n![Questionable Content Comic by Jeph Jacques](https://questionablecontent.net/comics/3953.png)\n\nI've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more _fatalistic_ and irrational towards things not going according to plan. \n\n### Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?\n*HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW*\n\nIt just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be. \n\nI will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.\n\n### Why are you telling us this?\nI'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood. \n\nIt took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help. \n\n**NOTE**:\n\nI understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.\n\nI can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more. \n\n![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/5ArJanyCfxgiY/giphy.gif)", "title": "My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done", "date": "2019-03-25T10:42:00-07:00", "slug": "anxiety-based-gtd", "category": "mental-health", "tags": "['anxiety', 'depression']", "url": "/anxiety-based-gtd", "date_published": "Mon, 25 Mar 2019 10:42:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Mar 25, 2019 10:42 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"no_index": "False", "_content": "In the past few weeks, I've been working on getting another (Yes another Podcast) up and running.

This is a good thing as I still have a day job and wouldn't be able to handle a massive influx of clients, but 6 months into this being a full business, I've learned something extremely valuable. \n\n## Your best clients and promoters are the ones you've been establishing a relationship with for a while.\n\nI've had a handful of coaching clients. Many coaching leads. I've also done some marketing services and some editing for folks as well. \n\n100% of my clients are either someone I know and interact with on a regular basis **or** they were recommended by the aforementioned person.\n\nWhile I have received many leads and people promising to check out my services and get back to me. This seems to only happen when there is a relationship that has already been established.\n\nI know I'm not telling you anything innovative here but I didn't realize the value of relationship building when it comes to finding clients. \n\n## Ways to do this\n### 1.  Establish yourself as a Professional in the field and Connect with other professionals.\n\n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/adult-brainstorming-communication-1181421.jpg)\n<small>photo credit #wocintechchat</small>\n\nOne of the biggest networks that I have been able to tap into is working with other developers that have podcasts. We have a slack workspace that we all hang out in. It started out as just a handful of us but now there are over 50 people in there. \n\nEach of them have their own reach and their own network. \nI've had them refer some of their audience to me when they are looking for a coaching client. \n\nI've also worked with a few of them as an editor when they need help with something. \n\n### 2. Nurture Strong Relationships with the Noguchi Method\nSome relationships are easy to maintain and others are more of a chore. I like to treat my relationships similar to the [Noguchi Filing Method](https://unclutterer.com/2014/06/03/the-noguchi-filing-system/). \n\nThe Noguchi Filing Method is simple. When you take out a file. Move it to the top of the stack (or front of the line) When you put it back. \n![](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/active-adult-beautiful-1799244.jpg)\n\nI do this in my head. The people that I just interacted with I try to interact with more. Over time you will connect with people that are receptive to maintaining a good relationship with you. Those will be the same people that will recommend you to potential clients or reach out to you if they have a need. \n\n### 3. Don't be afraid to ask those that you know (nicely)\nI got my first client by sending the following message to about 50 of my podcasting friends.\n\n> I've been working to bring PIT back at the beginning of 2019 (I have some coding things that need to get done first)\n\n> Also, PIT is now a business (officially). Aside from the podcast, I am doing content creation, coaching, and \"unicorn\" services.\n\n> I was inspired by Kathy Campbell. My goal is to just help people where I can. \n\n> Here is a list of the services I provide.\n\n> My skills include:\n> - social media\n> - recording videos and screencasts\n> - podcast editing and recording\n> - community management\n> - newsletter publishing\n\n> Do you have any ideas how I may be of any help?\n \n> Also if you know of anyone that I could help out with those things or individual or group productivity coaching, I would love an introduction.\n \nEveryone that I sent this to kindly replied that they either couldn't help me, or they would keep an eye and ear out. \n\nI didn't get upset I just said okay and continued to maintain a good relationship with them.\n\nOne person did have a need and to this day they have been my most consistent and biggest client. They've lead me to many other leads and clients that I've received over time.\n\nThe other thing about doing this that has been great is that now when I send out a message about some service I'm offering, it is that group of people that often like and repost that message to their audience. \n\n================\n\nNone of these things are all that time intensive and none of them leave you with this _grimy_ feeling as if you are peddling to your friends. Your \"inner-circle\" doesn't want to see you fail. In fact, they will be your biggest fan. It's up to you to nurture those relationships and make sure that you let them know of ways that they can help.", "title": "Friends have been my Greatest Asset!", "date": "2019-04-17T09:24:00-07:00", "category": "Marketing", "tags": "['networking', 'lead-capture']", "slug": "friends_have_been_my_greatest_asset", "url": "/friends_have_been_my_greatest_asset", "date_published": "Wed, 17 Apr 2019 09:24:00 -0700", "date_friendly": "Apr 17, 2019 09:24 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"no_index": "False", "_content": "Late last year I made the decision to go full time analog productivity. To me this was a return to my _Midori Traveller's Notebook_ and less reliability on mobile applications to keep track of things. \n\nWith January being a new year I thought it would be a great time to really do my best and dig in on this process. I didn't realize that I was going to be extremely busy with things and that my notebook would be crucial in keeping my sanity. \n\n### What went well\nSince I've been reading [_The Bullet Journal Method_][bullet journal] by Ryder Carrol, I really wanted to make things very simple. This meant reducing the amount of things that I tracked. I had previously tried to keep up with logging my food, how many times I fell into a tunnel of distraction, my water intake, and many other things. No more of that. \n\nThis time I wrote down all the things I wanted to track and in _Marie Kondo_ style, and tried to reduce the list to only things that were \"essential\" to the art of bullet journaling and things that I knew I wanted to make a habit of. \n\nWith the rebirth of the [Productivity in Tech Podcast][pitpodcast] and the creation of [Ask a Brit][aab] I wanted to make sure that I was publishing consistently. I also wanted to track how often I coded and read, two things that I tended to rely on momentum to be consistent with.\n\nAnother big convept that helped me more than I thought it would was the idea behind threading. This was simply adding an arrow to the left followed by the page number of the continued thought. Also I add an arrow to the right and the page number for the next page I take the thought to. This makes it rather easy to add reference to items, which allows me to retrive information faster (and fill out my index, which I am terrible about).  \n\n### What didn't go so well\nThere is still one area that I haven't fully is my management of a calendar. I had some big dates to remember for this year and I wasn't quite sure how to manage it with more and more going into my notebook. My podcast schedule is completely digital as it is tracked using calendly, google calendar, and Notion. Hopefully Notion will provide some kind of integration with G-Suite so that I don't have to manage this in multiple places. While I could just keep everything in my google calendar, I really don't rely on it as much as you think, but I haven't gotten into the habit of transferring items into my Analog calendar. This caused for some double-scheduling that could have been easily avoided. \n\nAnother failed experiment was abandoning the daily spread for a weekly theme. I quickly have to revert to this as I would have things that would stretch across several pages (and days) This meant that I was doing more unneccessary flipping through pages instead of just doing a daily review and transfer of information that helped me to prepare myself through the day. \n\n### My thoughts going into February\nFebruary is going to be a test on consistency for me. I've proven that I can work from my notebook like I used to. As this trust has returned, I can continue to focus on adding more and more content and collections into it. I also think my current notebook will fill up in the middle of the month which will bring about a migration which I will definitely talk about at that time.", "title": "January 2019 Bullet Journal Recap", "date": "2019-02-01T16:00:00-08:00", "category": "Analog", "tags": "['Bullet Journal', 'Reflection']", "slug": "january_2019_bullet_journal_recap", "url": "/january_2019_bullet_journal_recap", "date_published": "Fri, 01 Feb 2019 16:00:00 -0800", "date_friendly": "Feb 01, 2019 16:00 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"no_index": "False", "_content": "Heidi is a Developer Advocate for [Launch Darkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com/).  \n  \nHeidi travels all over the world and is away from home more than half of the month.  \n  \nIn this conversation, Heidi shares with how she\u2019s able to parent, prepare, and connect with her co-workers while always being on the go.  \n  \n**  \nLinks:**\n\n  * [Follow Heidi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Wiredferret)\n  * [Launch Darkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com/)\n  * [I Have ADD and So Can Ooh, Shiny! - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVW67KSwwo)\n  \nSupport the Productivity in Tech podcast and other independent podcasts at [https:ko-fi.com/JayandJayMedia](https:ko-fi.com/JayandJayMedia).  \n  \nOR  \n  \nConsider joining the [PIT Premium Membership](https://productivityintech.com/memberships)\n\n**[\u2605 Support this podcast by donating \u2605](Https://ko-fi.com/jayandjaymedia)**", "title": "Travel, Parenting, and ADHD with Heidi Waterhouse", "date": "2019-03-04T18:05:00-08:00", "category": "Podcast", "link": "https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/episodes/travel-parenting-and-adhd-with-heidi-waterhouse", "slug": "travel,_parenting,_and_adhd_with_heidi_waterhouse", "url": "/travel,_parenting,_and_adhd_with_heidi_waterhouse", "date_published": "Mon, 04 Mar 2019 18:05:00 -0800", "date_friendly": "Mar 04, 2019 18:05 PM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"no_index": "False", "_content": "This week on the Productivity in Tech Podcast, I spoke with John Knox.\n\nJohn left Evernote in Austin, TX to join his partner in Minneapolis, MN. \n\nWe talk about what it was like searching for a job and what Companies and Candidates can do better in the hiring process. \n\nSign up for the newsletter to get access to the Aftershow where John interviews me!\n<https://buttondown.email/productivityintech>", "title": "[Podcast] PIT Podcast Ep 5: What Companies AND Candidates can do Better in the Hiring Process with John Knox", "date": "2019-02-04T08:00:00-08:00", "_url": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/dc4ab395", "slug": "podcast_pit_podcast_ep_5:_what_companies_and_candidates_can_do_better_in_the_hiring_process_with_john_knox", "url": "/podcast_pit_podcast_ep_5:_what_companies_and_candidates_can_do_better_in_the_hiring_process_with_john_knox", "date_published": "Mon, 04 Feb 2019 08:00:00 -0800", "date_friendly": "Feb 04, 2019 08:00 AM", "routes": "['', '/blog']", "template": "blog.html"}, {"no_index": "False", "_content": "<div class=\"notification is-dark\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-light\">Update:</h2>\n<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nI do a lot of work in the terminal.

If they are hateful, you can block them and never hear from them again. Most people only reply for attention so I doubt they would reply unless they really wanted to connect with you.\n\nI've met so many wonderful people. I've seen so many wonderful things, and it's been because of social media, but I'm tired.\n\n- I'm tired of being sold to (and I'm a Marketer). \n- I'm tired of being told to yell at people. \n \nI'm just SO TIRED. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nDear Social Media Companies:\n\tI don't care about followers anymore.\n\n\tDon't allow me to follow people, allow me to follow ideas and inspiration. \n\n\tI know this doesn't help your agenda. I know you don't care about me. I don't affect your bottom line. \n\n\tDon't you realize the pain you cause people? Does that mean nothing to you?\n\nAnother tear-filled, anxiety-stricken day. I'm exhausted. I feel I've aged 30 years in the last 10. I want respite, but at the same time, giving up all of this means losing connection all the wonderful people and benefits I can only find online through DMs. \n\nI'm literally digging through mountains of excrement to find the occasional life changing connections.\n\n\nI'm okay, I'm just disappearing for a while.\n\nThe perfect end to this rant is the exact response I would expect from my fellow millennials. \n\n...

Times are Tough. It's been tough for me as well. I found out my mother had COVID-19. She has since recovered. That's all I'll say about that. \n\nI've been on the day job working from home. For those that don't know, my immune system is compromised from my time in the Marines. That said I cough enough to scare people into staying clear of me. I think that is going to be coming to an end soon, although I feel like I've been more productive since.\n\nThis Month, I purchased [DevonThink](https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink). I don't love or hate using it, which gives me a confident feeling that I'll use it as a tool and not fiddle with it all that much. My current strategy is to just add things to it and then clean it up once a week/month/haven't really decided yet. I've also looked at some of the other [DevonTechnologies](https://devontechnologies.com) Tools. I will have some quick thoughts maybe released as a blog post in the near future. I was even able to convince my friends on the [TekTok Podcast] to join me on it.\n\n![DevonThink](https://kjaymiller.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/CleanShot-2020-05-25-at-23.34.03.png)\n\n## Posts\n\n- [Quick Productivity Tip - Walk and Talks](https://kjaymiller.com/quick_productivity_tip_-_walk_and_talks)\n- [Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda](https://kjaymiller.com/qtp-family-agenda)\n\n## Projects\n\n### Render Engine \n* Made a few changes to clean up URL's. This was because once upon a time I would add links to my PIT Podcast titles to my [personal blog]\n* Fixed my RSS Feeds (Finally). They did change so if you are interested you can subscribe to them here or on my website.\n* Support for Categories and Tags\n\n### Transcriptor\nI launched Transcriptor this past month. Check out the [announcement post], to learn more. \n\n### Episde-DL\n\n[Episode-DL](https://pypi.org/project/Episode-DL/) is just a little utility that I added to PyPI because I tend to need to download mp3's from RSS feeds all the time. This isn't some ground breaking tool and really just has three functions. All in all, this was just a way for me to remember how I do something that I don't have to do all the time, but I do enough that this helped.\n\n### Following Me\nYou can reach me on Twitter, Micro.Blog, or My Website. You can also just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.\n\nIf you have an RSS Reader that you use.
