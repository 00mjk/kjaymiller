            <p>Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/kjaymiller">sponsoring all my projects</a>! </p>

<h2><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> was one of the first apps that I saw that was taking advantage of iCloud sync. There are many apps like <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a>. There is also the darling <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>. </p>

<p>I noticed these subscription services were paying mostly for plain-text storage. I could get the URL, the title, and tags, but if I wanted access to the content, good luck. Even when I could store offline versions of pages, I couldn't access them via an API. I wanted to be able to integrate my bookmarking service and make it searchable with other tools. </p>

<p>Goodlinks is a bookmarking service with great simplicity, which is what I was looking for. Everything is available and stored locally via iCloud with. I recently figured out how to <a href="http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-your-browser-history/">get access to Safari history</a>.  I think I can do something similar with GoodLinks.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/Goodreads.png" alt="My Goodlinks Board" /></p>

<p>Right now, I'm bookmarking web things in GoodLinks. When I feel I have enough content to release another TIFOTIR, I pull from there (instead of my head).</p>

<h2><a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula Theme</a></h2>

<p>I spend much of my time in [iTerm2]. Just because the terminal may be an <em>old- school</em> way of doing things doesn't mean I should keep my screen in the old school. [Oh-my-zsh] gives me plenty of great plugin access and themes out of the box, but I wanted a theme that was somewhat subtle that would just pop out some of the information that I should be looking for.</p>

<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cxazzw3yew/iTerm%20with%20Dracula%20Theme.png" alt="My Terminal with the Dracula Theme" /></p>

<p>[Dracula] does a wonderful job not adding a lot of complexity to my terminal but emphasizes bits of data. Also they have many themes for other applications. I am also using their <a href="https://draculatheme.com/alfred">Alfred Theme</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://catvscode.hashnode.dev/what-i-learned-from-close-call-interviews">What I learned from Close Call Interviews</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/@catvscode">@catvscodes</a>)</h2>

<p>I met to Cat via Twitter. She's a wonderful UI Engineer with a ton of experience. That said, HIRE HER if you're hiring!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time not getting interviews (straight ghosted 👻). Cat's been getting so close in interviews. It hurts a lot when the you invest a lot of time into landing that job and you don't get it.</p>

<p>This was a good reminder of a few things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never, ever believe anything anyone says until the offer is in front of your face with your name on it...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if they didn't pick you, it's their loss. Don't waste time fretting about why it wasn't you or singing the hymn of the impostor on repeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a little bit of a bummer but it's a reality that we often don't think about. Thank you Cat for the perspective and I'm seriously rooting for you!</p>

<h2><a href="https://glasnt.com/blog/on-collecting-nos">On Collecting No's</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">@glasnt</a>)</h2>

<p>Funny thing happened the other day, I got a rejection email from a conference saying that my talk. This was a conference that I REALLY wanted to speak at. I had also recieved rejections to a few other conferences a couple weeks before. On top of that, I am an advocate so speaking at conferences is a bit of an expectation. </p>

<p>Recently, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt">Katie</a> at a conference organizers meeting. She's absolutely wonderful and a fellow advocate. She wrote a post a while back about putting conference talk rejections into perspective.</p>

<p>My personal Favorite note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your submission was a sales pitch. Okay, look. I know. Sales people gotta sales. But, when a conferences asks “No pitches” and you throw a dozen “BUY ME NOW” submissions, yeah, you’re going to get rejected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah the funny part... Apparently, I submitted two talks to the conference and the other one was with a different account. They accepted that talk but message went to spam. Luckily I was looking for another email and found it... 😅</p>

<p>I normally don't promote these big editorial teams, but as a dev-dad, I am always trying to get fun projects for me and the little one to play around with. We use KiwiCo and she get the 2-5 year old's box. I do plan on looking into some of the other boxes in the new year. </p>
