In this tutorial, I'm gonna show you how to take the images that come in from our product managers and upload them into storefront catalog.

00:00:13:

So the first thing that we need to do is get our image. This particular image came in from our product manager, Don.

00:00:26:

 He sent the image via email so we would get this image from our email. You may also get these images via Sharepoint as well. 
 
00:00:33:

And then we want to make sure that we are setting up the image to fit properly into our storefront e-commerce platform.

00:00:47:

Now, there isn't really much of a limit, but we want to make a consistent shopping experience for our customer. So we actually created our own image standards for the images themselves.

00:01:03:

And that standard is they need to be 850 by 850 on a preferably transparent  or single-color background.

00:01:15:

And then finally, we want to make sure that we save it as RGB format.

00:01:23:

Now, of course, you also want to make sure that your original copy is saved inside of our long term storage so that the other folks on the team can go and use the image as well.


00:01:43:

Now we're going to just make sure that the image that we currently have is fitting all of those parameters.

00:01:50:

And are a few ways to do it.

00:01:51:

You can use your standard image editing tool like Photoshop or you can use an automation tool like retrobatch.

00:01:57:

We have the adobe suite at our disposal, but I'm currently using affinity photo because it is a little easier on my machine while we're in quarantine.

Now with Affinity Photo/ Photoshop, all you would do is load the image in, crop it to a 1by1 ratio and expand beyond the image.

00:02:43:

If there's a little bit of space in between the image boundary and the item itself, then you can kind of go inwards but in most cases, you're gonna want to go outwards.

00:02:53:

And what will do is add some blank canvas on to the end that you can edit it around.

00:02:59:

Now, this image that they gave me was a clean image on a white background.

00:03:04:

So not too much to worry about, but we could go and edit the background if it had some color to it.

00:03:17:

But basically, we're gonna make it this square.

00:03:19:

It's gonna add that extra bit so we're gonna take out the background, and then we're going to scale it as 850 by 850 with the Resolution being 72.

00:03:30:

If the source image is a little shorter than that, go ahead and scale it up to 850 by 850. If it's way too small and it's gonna become pixelated, then you need to just ask for a better image.

00:03:40:

Usually you can ask the product managers or you can go to the vendor directly.

00:03:45:

They often have hi-res images available on their website and you can find them with a quick Google search.

00:03:53:

Don't pull an image from a competitor. Pull it from the manufacturer, and then you'll be good to go with that.

00:04:00:

So the other thing, the other option here is to use an automation tool like retrobatch.

00:04:26:

Now, retrobatch is something that I personally own.

00:04:29:

I like it because it allows me to set the rules, and kind of create a visual workflow that it will use. You can also do something like this with Photoshop's automation, but I found that to be a little wonky at times. This method is quick and consistent so I use it.

00:04:34:

There are some other ways that you can do this. If you're uploading 40,000 images, um, there are some really powerful command line tools that will do all of this behind the scenes saving your computer a little bit of processing time, but I do feel like you have to really know what you're doing to use those tools and 9 times of 10 you will not need that much power.

00:05:16:

So with retro batch, Like I said, you just you have your blocks here, you have your read block of your write block and you just load the image in to your read block.

00:05:41:

You can load as many images as you want, and then you just help to play, and then it a rates through that read lists, and it saves them out and the write block on the information that you've submitted.

00:05:51:

Now I paid for retrobatch myself. It's $50, but I would highly recommend it if you're going to be scaling these images with any amount of regularity. I'll include my retrobatch workflow as well.

00:05:55:

I would recommend, you know, talking with your boss and seeing if they'll cover it.

And of course, you can find that at the retrobatch website, which is at flying meat dot com.

00:06:24:

Now, before we add our image to store front, we need to make sure that the image is renamed.

00:06:57:

So you're gonna make sure whatever the image was before. The product managers are often asked to rename it before they send it to you.

00:07:02:

But sometimes this doesn't happen. In this case, it didn't happen.

00:07:06:

So we're gonna rename this to our item number.

00:07:12:

And there's a reason why we're gonna do this, because it makes it easier when we uploaded to storefront. Let's just rename it and then we're gonna open up storefront catalogue.

00:07:21:

We're gonna log in with our username and password, and then from there, we're going to go to attachments and upload really it, browse at our image, and then at the bottom, we're going to check the box that says make item assignment.

00:07:43:

Now, this is kind of tricky, because if you just have the single image, you can, of course, just loaded as a single image.

00:07:51:

If you have multiple images What you want to do is you want to give it the item number and then you want to add an underscore and like a index number so item number underscore one item number, underscore to item number, underscore three.

00:08:05:

You can also upload multiple images for several items as long as they each are named after their item.

00:08:08:

And then you would save that as a zip file with all of the items inside of it.

00:08:20:

And Storefront knows what to do. 

And that's it.

00:08:24:

Back in the day, we used to rerun the system processes that runs overnight.

00:08:28:

 Now, that takes way too long because of the number of items that we have.

00:08:33:

 But that is all you have to do to get an item loaded onto storefront.

00:08:39:

The jobs process overnight, so it's usually available first thing in the morning.
